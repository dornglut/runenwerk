# Testing and Validation

Tests belong with the owner of the invariant they prove. Prefer behavior tests, typed APIs, dependency checks, and conformance cases over source-string guards.

## Focused checks

Use the smallest checks that exercise the changed package while implementing, for example:

```text
cargo test -p <package>
cargo clippy -p <package> --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
python tools/docs/validate_docs.py
```

Focused checks support iteration. They do not replace the merge baseline.

## Integration-test boundaries

An integration-test executable represents an actual isolation or external-boundary requirement, not an individual issue, milestone, phase, or small contract. Related contract tests should normally be modules inside a boundary-owned integration target.

Keep separate executables where platform behavior, process or environment isolation, compile-fail behavior, crash or panic isolation, native GPU conformance, or explicit backend/runtime evidence requires them. Target consolidation must not introduce shared mutable runtime state or weaken test isolation.

## Required baseline

Before merge:

```text
cargo validate
git diff --check
```

`cargo validate` is read-only and lockfile-safe. It validates the repository tooling, formats the workspace, runs locked workspace tests, runs strict Clippy, validates documentation, and checks durable repository invariants.

Rust CI resolves, explicitly checks out, and validates the reviewed feature head for pull requests; push and dispatch use `github.sha`. That exact-head result is the merge authority for the baseline.

## Documentation build

Documentation changes also run the Astro/Starlight production build through the path-scoped documentation workflow. It independently selects and proves the same event-derived repository revision; its workflow-definition ref may be a synthetic merge ref, distinct from the checked-out contents.

## RunenGPU conformance

RunenGPU implementation and conformance changes additionally run the path-scoped `RunenGPU Conformance` workflow. It independently selects and proves the reviewed repository revision. The native job restricts Vulkan loading to the installed Mesa software Vulkan implementation and executes the ignored public G5B runtime and offscreen-render integration proofs. The Wasm job checks the RunenGPU-containing engine library for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with the locked dependency graph.

This is supplemental evidence required by the affected RunenGPU slice, not a second Rust baseline or general hardware/browser certification. Native claims are limited to the exact tests and Vulkan software adapter actually executed; Wasm compilation proves target compatibility only and does not claim browser runtime behavior. `cargo validate` remains the repository-owned merge baseline.

## Evidence

Report focused checks, `cargo validate`, exact-head CI, and anything not run. Do not convert source inspection or user-reported output into a stronger validation claim.

The accepted base, reviewed feature head, synthetic merge result, squash commit, and accepted-main push result are separate evidence objects.

Long-form workflow authority lives in [`docs-site/src/content/docs/workspace/engineering-workflow.md`](docs-site/src/content/docs/workspace/engineering-workflow.md).

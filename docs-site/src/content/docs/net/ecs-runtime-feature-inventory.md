# ECS Runtime Feature Inventory (April 2026, Superseded)

This page is retained only as historical navigation for the April 2026 audit. It no longer describes the current repository state.

Subsequent accepted RunenECS repairs materially changed the audited boundary:

- C6 removed the mixed broadcast/work-queue/tick-buffer messaging authority from RunenECS;
- C7 separated ownership, networking, replay, and application lifecycle policy from ECS-local semantics;
- C8 moved reusable ECS scheduling/access/deferred semantics into RunenECS and retired the standalone `domain/scheduler` package and its application-shaped barrier authority.

Do not use the former `domain/scheduler`, `Broadcast*`, `WorkQueue*`, `TickBuffer*`, ownership-registry, stage-flush, or scheduler-barrier statements from this audit as current API or architecture evidence.

Use current authority instead:

- [Standalone RunenECS architecture](https://github.com/dornglut/runen-ecs/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Repository Family Extraction Boundaries](../adr/accepted/0014-repository-family-extraction-boundaries.md)
- [Current multiplayer replication roadmap](./multiplayer-replication-implementation-roadmap.md)

The original audit remains recoverable from repository history when historical comparison is required.

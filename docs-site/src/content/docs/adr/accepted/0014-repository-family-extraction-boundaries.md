# ADR 0014: Repository Family Extraction Boundaries

## Decision

Runenwerk is the integration and product repository for independently usable peer
frameworks:

```text
product       repository                 package       crate
RunenSDF      Crystonix/runen-sdf        runen-sdf     runen_sdf
RunenECS      target Crystonix/runen-ecs package topology governed separately
RunenGPU      Crystonix/runen-gpu        runen-gpu     runen_gpu
RunenRender   Crystonix/runen-render     runen-render  runen_render
RunenUI       Crystonix/runen-ui         existing workspace; current packages include runenui_core and runenui_runtime
```

RunenSDF and RunenUI already exist as independent workstreams. RunenECS,
RunenGPU, and RunenRender remain governed by their accepted boundary designs and
clean-cutover evidence.

Framework repositories must not depend on Runenwerk. Integration-specific
translation, application lifecycle, product policy, and cross-framework
composition remain in Runenwerk.

RunenGPU and RunenRender each begin with one public package. This decision does not redefine RunenUI package topology or settle RunenECS package topology. Additional packages
require independently useful dependency, backend, release, ABI, or compile-time
pressure. Repository extraction is not itself justification for package
proliferation.

## Dependency direction

The accepted family direction is:

```text
RunenSDF ----+
RunenECS ----+--> Runenwerk adapters/integration --> applications
RunenUI -----+
                  |
                  +--> RunenRender --> RunenGPU
                  +--> non-render RunenGPU workloads
```

The default rule is framework independence. A direct framework dependency requires
a separate ADR proving independent value and correct ownership.

ADR 0015 accepts exactly one such foundational dependency:

```text
RunenRender -> RunenGPU
```

This dependency is valid because image formation requires GPU execution, while
RunenGPU remains independently useful for compute, simulation, field realization,
procedural tools, bakers, and offscreen workloads.

RunenSDF, RunenECS, and RunenUI do not depend on RunenGPU or RunenRender merely
because an application may accelerate or display their outputs.

## Current program state

### RunenSDF

The corrected standalone repository transfer completed at:

```text
repository: Crystonix/runen-sdf
commit: d52badefc640d6dc6dcdd40268af3aea1bb8eefe
```

Current Runenwerk `main` does not yet contain a merged clean-cutover removal of
`domain/sdf`. That decision remains separate from the completed standalone
transfer.

### RunenECS

Internal ownership and safety repairs remain required before source movement.

### RunenGPU and RunenRender

The previous renderer-owned-WGPU target is superseded. GPU execution must be
separated before rendering extraction. No implementation phase is authorized
until the complete current-source S0 inventory is accepted.

### RunenUI

RunenUI remains an independent peer governed in its own repository. This ADR does
not select its internal APIs or implementation roadmap.

## Extraction order

Tracks may investigate in parallel, but structural changes that share manifests,
lockfiles, identity policy, or canonical architecture must be serialized or
explicitly rebased.

The dependency-constrained order is:

1. complete any separately approved RunenSDF clean cutover;
2. repair and prove RunenECS before extraction;
3. inventory the current combined GPU/render implementation;
4. separate and extract RunenGPU;
5. separate RunenRender on the accepted RunenGPU boundary;
6. extract RunenRender;
7. consider reusable cross-framework adapters after public contracts stabilize.

## Clean cutover

Every completed extraction must:

- preserve source provenance and licensing;
- establish independent validation and public downstream conformance;
- pin Runenwerk to an exact revision or exact pre-release version;
- migrate every active consumer;
- delete the original Runenwerk implementation in the completed cutover;
- remove temporary migration seams before merge;
- leave no compatibility package, forwarding namespace, source mirror, submodule,
  branch dependency, or writable parallel authority.

Temporary duplication may exist only on an unmerged extraction branch.

If current Runenwerk has no real consumer for an extracted framework, removal of
the internal package does not require adding an unused external dependency.

## Ownership decisions

### RunenSDF

RunenSDF owns reusable signed-field mathematics, validated field vocabulary,
numerical policy, bounds, composition, transforms, capabilities, and CPU reference
queries. It does not own Runenwerk geometry, world streaming, ECS, rendering,
materials, GPU execution, or product policy.

### RunenECS

RunenECS owns entity/component/resource lifecycle, storage and query semantics,
deferred structural mutation, system access contracts, explicit reflection, and
ECS-local scheduling integration.

General spatial indexing, engine lifecycle, rendering extraction, networking,
replay, world policy, and product scheduling remain outside ECS core.

### RunenGPU

RunenGPU owns validated GPU capabilities, resources, access/lifetimes, workloads,
submissions, uploads/readback, low-level surfaces, backend outcomes, and WGPU as
the initial internal backend.

It does not own renderer semantics, simulations, fields, ECS, UI, windows/event
loops, shader filesystem policy, or product recovery.

### RunenRender

RunenRender owns prepared render scenes, views, providers/interactions,
materials/media, emitters, visibility, transport, radiance caches,
reconstruction, overlays, color, presentation intent, and lowering into RunenGPU
workloads.

It does not own general GPU execution, WGPU directly, ECS extraction, field/SDF
mathematics, UI semantics, native-window policy, or Runenwerk lifecycle.

### RunenUI

RunenUI owns semantic UI, state, actions, focus, accessibility, layout/style,
text, hit testing, and renderer-neutral paint output. It does not depend on
RunenRender or RunenGPU by default.

### Runenwerk

Runenwerk owns lifecycle, scheduling, windows/event loops, ECS/domain extraction,
scene/world/material/SDF/UI/editor/simulation adapters, shader source discovery and
reload policy, product quality/capability selection, diagnostics presentation,
recovery, and integration evidence.

## Adapter rule

A framework must remain useful without its Runenwerk adapter.

A Runenwerk adapter may depend on Runenwerk and one or more framework contracts
when its purpose is explicitly cross-framework translation. No framework depends
back on the adapter.

Adapters translate identities, prepared inputs, outputs, lifecycle facts,
diagnostics, and ownership. They must not:

- copy framework algorithms;
- mirror source;
- create writable parallel authority;
- hide dependency cycles;
- expose broad compatibility facades.

A reusable bridge is extracted only after at least one independent consumer proves
that the bridge itself has stable ownership.

## Shared infrastructure

Do not create a universal `RunenCore`, shared meta-framework, universal ID
repository, universal diagnostics repository, or generic plugin framework merely
to make extraction convenient.

Each repository owns values and identities whose invariants it defines. Adapters
map them explicitly and preserve upstream diagnostics/provenance.

## Versioning and formats

Before stable publication, cross-repository dependencies use exact revisions or
exact pre-release versions. Moving branches are forbidden.

Persisted source, artifact, trace, replay, cache, and wire formats each require a
separate owner, identifier, version, validation policy, and migration policy.
Runtime IDs are not silently promoted into persisted identity.

## Consequences

- Existing code location is implementation evidence, not permanent ownership.
- RunenSDF provides the first standalone transfer proof.
- RunenECS source movement remains blocked by internal ownership/safety work.
- RunenGPU must be proven and extracted before RunenRender.
- RunenRender consumes RunenGPU through a public one-way dependency.
- RunenUI remains independent.
- Connector inspection does not substitute for executable validation.
- No implementation contract is written before its current-source inventory is
  complete.

## Rejected alternatives

Rejected:

- extracting current directories unchanged;
- one repository containing SDF, ECS, GPU, rendering, and UI;
- Git submodules or source mirrors;
- a universal shared-core repository;
- speculative multi-package repository skeletons;
- long-lived compatibility packages;
- making RunenUI or RunenSDF depend on rendering for integration convenience;
- retaining WGPU ownership in RunenRender;
- moving Runenwerk-specific product policy into framework packages.

## Fitness functions

The program succeeds only when:

- each framework validates independently;
- Runenwerk consumes exact revisions through one-way public dependencies;
- independent downstream consumers use public APIs;
- framework repositories contain no Runenwerk assumptions;
- adapters translate rather than duplicate algorithms;
- original Runenwerk implementations are removed after cutover;
- no dependency cycle, source mirror, compatibility authority, or duplicate path
  remains;
- provenance, licensing, compatibility, and current documentation are complete.

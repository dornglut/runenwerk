# Editor Procedural Content and Simulation Workflow Plan

## Purpose

Define the feature-complete plan for Runenwerk's procedural authoring workflows:

- SDF modeling;
- SDF/world texturing and material channels;
- procedural texturing;
- triplanar mapping;
- PBR material products;
- Texture2D, Texture3D, and volume/field texture workflows;
- particles and VFX;
- physics and collision;
- animation and procedural motion;
- simulation/world processes such as fluids, snow, sediment, erosion, and material transport.

This plan is SDF-first and field-world-first. Mesh, GLB, and imported material workflows may exist as reference and compatibility paths, but they are not the engine's primary world-authoring substrate.

## Repo Truth Baseline

Implemented today:

- `domain/sdf/src/field.rs::SdfField3` owns analytic SDF sampling.
- `domain/sdf/src/primitives/`, `domain/sdf/src/ops/`, and `domain/sdf/src/queries/` own primitives, composition, transforms, raymarch, projection, classification, and sweep foundations.
- `domain/world_ops/src/operations.rs::Operation` has SDF/world operation vocabulary for legacy `CsgAdd`/`CsgSubtract`, normalized `CsgBrushOperation` modes for P1 Add/Subtract/Intersect/SmoothAdd/SmoothSubtract/SmoothIntersect, `Smooth`, `Stamp`, `StructurePlace`, `MaterialFieldEdit`, and `DensityFieldDeform`.
- `domain/world_ops/src/build_graph.rs::BuildGraphPhase` already includes `SdfFieldBuild`, `SummaryBuild`, `DerivedRenderBuild`, and `Publish`.
- `engine/src/plugins/world/build/jobs.rs::dispatch_world_build_jobs_system` builds deterministic chunk payloads from operation windows and tracks material channel masks.
- `domain/world_sdf/src/storage.rs::SdfChunkStore` owns chunk/page/brick SDF payload records.
- `domain/world_sdf/src/collision.rs::CollisionQueryService` owns field-query collision readiness and sweep result contracts.
- `engine/src/plugins/world` owns authoritative chunked SDF runtime state, operation logs, dirty/build integration, prepared world feature payloads, world-to-render invalidation, and streaming/replication read models.
- `domain/graph` owns only neutral graph structure and validation.
- `docs-site/src/content/docs/design/active/semantic-graph-ir-and-compilation-design.md` defines the policy for future semantic graph domains.
- `engine/src/plugins/render` has `RenderFlow`, compute/fullscreen/graphics/copy/present passes, shader registry/hot reload, sampled/storage texture descriptors, prepared render-frame contributions, and a `MATERIAL_RENDER_FEATURE_ID` slot.
- `engine/src/plugins/render/frame/contributions.rs::PreparedMaterialFeatureContribution` exists as render prepared-frame plumbing for material instances, specialization fragments, and parameter blobs.
- `domain/editor/editor_core/src/document.rs::DocumentKind` has explicit M6 document kinds for SDF graphs, materials, textures, procgen, gameplay graph, particles, physics, animation, timelines, and runtime debug documents.
- `domain/editor/editor_shell/src/workspace/profile.rs::default_workspace_profile_registry` has M6 workspace profiles for field worlds, materials, textures, procgen, gameplay graph, particles, physics, animation, simulation processes, runtime debug, and neutral graphs.
- `domain/editor/editor_shell/src/workspace/state.rs::ToolSurfaceKind` and persisted workspace contracts include M6 tool surfaces for graph, diagnostics, runtime debug, SDF graph, field layers, materials, textures, procgen, gameplay graph, particles, physics, animation, and simulation.
- `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/providers/m6_workspace.rs::M6WorkspaceProvider` provides fail-closed placeholder routing and diagnostics for M6 surfaces until each owning provider exists.
- `domain/material_graph` owns the first material graph contract slice: authored material graph documents, first-slice node catalog, semantic ratification, deterministic lowering, source maps, cache keys, and formed material product descriptors.
- `domain/texture` owns the first texture contract slice: Texture2D and Texture3D/volume descriptors, sampler/color-space/compression metadata, generated texture product lineage, preview descriptors, and ratification.
- `domain/asset/src/kind.rs::AssetKind`, `domain/asset/src/import_settings.rs::ImportSettings`, `domain/asset/src/artifact.rs::ArtifactPayloadKind`, `domain/editor/editor_preview/src/product.rs::RuntimeProductKind`, and `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/asset_pipeline/catalog_runtime.rs::reload_decision_for_kind` can represent material and texture product families while keeping authored material graphs unsupported for runtime reload.
- `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/providers/material_graph_canvas.rs::MaterialGraphCanvasProvider`, `material_inspector.rs::MaterialInspectorProvider`, `material_preview.rs::MaterialPreviewProvider`, `texture_viewer.rs::TextureViewerProvider`, and `volume_texture_viewer.rs::VolumeTextureViewerProvider` provide descriptor-first M6.1 surfaces over material/texture domain contracts, asset artifacts, reload diagnostics, and typed texture preview descriptors.
- `domain/editor/editor_scene/src/sdf_authoring/` owns P1 authored SDF operation documents, SDF graph documents over `domain/graph`, command intents, ratification, projection DTOs, deterministic lowering to `world_ops::OperationRecord` windows, and CPU field-preview formation for scalar distance, vector gradient, occupancy, and material-channel products.
- `domain/world_sdf/src/preview.rs` owns CPU field-preview product payload DTOs and descriptor/payload ratification.
- `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/providers/field_layer_stack.rs::FieldLayerStackProvider`, `sdf_graph_canvas.rs::SdfGraphCanvasProvider`, and `field_product_viewer.rs::FieldProductViewerProvider` provide concrete P1 SDF operation, graph, commit, invalidation, and field-preview surfaces through typed shell/domain proposals.

Missing today:

- no `domain/procgen`;
- no `domain/particles`;
- no `domain/physics`;
- no `domain/animation`;
- no `domain/simulation_process`;
- no `domain/gameplay_graph` and no accepted gameplay event/action/state/quest contract set for gameplay graph lowering;
- no concrete editor providers for procedural generation preview, particles, physics authoring/debug, animation timeline, curve editing, or simulation preview;
- no source-backed material graph document persistence/import workflow beyond descriptor-first material/texture provider surfaces;
- no rendered/GPU SDF overlay adapter for formed field previews;
- no rendered material preview adapter or Texture3D GPU upload/runtime adapter;
- no full PBR preview capability matrix for height/displacement, ambient occlusion, opacity/mask, or normal handling;
- no particle simulation contract;
- no general rigid/character physics domain;
- no animation clip/graph/timeline domain.

## Governing Model

Procedural authoring follows this pipeline:

```text
Authored procedural document
  -> structural validation
  -> domain ratification
  -> normalized semantic IR
  -> deterministic lowering or formation plan
  -> formed product
  -> asset catalog artifact/revision
  -> runtime/preview instantiation
  -> expression products for viewport/tool surfaces
```

Runtime must not interpret editor-authored graphs every frame.

Authoring graphs are intent. Formed products are runtime-facing truth.

## Closed Default Decisions

These defaults close the first implementation direction. Change them only by updating this design or adding an ADR.

- SDF modeling is the primary world-authoring path. Mesh, GLB, and imported material workflows are compatibility/reference paths.
- Material graph starts with SDF/field preview, PBR parameter products, procedural texture nodes, triplanar coordinates, and field material-channel output. It does not start with mesh material import.
- Procedural texture generation starts with deterministic domain formation and cached products. GPU generation is a runtime optimization behind the same formed product contract.
- Texture3D is a first-class volume/field texture product with dimension, color-space, sampler, compression, channel, and slice/mip inspection metadata.
- Particles start with deterministic authored emitter and simulation contracts, SDF/field spawn/collision, and editor preview. GPU compute/render integration is an engine backend and must not change authored particle documents.
- Physics starts with `world_sdf` collision readiness, rigid/kinematic/character body contracts, collider descriptors, layer/mask/material authoring, and debug surfaces. A concrete external solver adapter is engine-owned.
- Animation starts with clips, typed curves, timeline, state/blend graphs, procedural motion, events, bindings, and SDF/world-aware motion hooks. Skeletal animation is supported by contracts, but SDF/world-aware procedural motion is first-class.
- World processes start with bounded preview layers and explicit bake/commit into governed `world_ops` records.

## Required Design Follow-Ups

Before implementation starts on a feature track, create or update the owning design/domain docs below. These are not optional polish; they are the contracts that stop editor providers from inventing private behavior.

## Milestone Sequence

### P0 - Structural Prerequisites

Close editor document tabs, provider routing, scoped modes, asset catalog, field-product formation, and viewport expression products.

Exit criteria:

- `domain/editor/editor_core/src/document.rs::DocumentKind` has explicit procedural document kinds;
- asset catalog can represent SDF graph, material graph, texture, Texture3D, particle, physics, animation, and procgen assets;
- viewport/tool surfaces consume typed expression products, not renderer-private textures;
- `python3 tools/docs/validate_docs.py` passes.

Status after the 2026-05-09 drift check: the shared workspace/profile/surface vocabulary, persisted tool-workspace layout support, asset taxonomy, material/texture artifact payload kinds, material/texture import settings, runtime product kinds, and fail-closed M6 provider routing exist in the current worktree. Concrete document save/load behavior remains per implemented document family and must not be claimed for future M6 domains.

### P1 - SDF Modeling Core

Deliver SDF primitives, brush editing, operation layers, SDF graph authoring, and formed field previews.

Status after the 2026-05-09 P1 closeout: complete for the CPU/editor-surface boundary. Authored operation layers and source-backed SDF graph documents lower through the same normalized operation-window path; all P1 boolean intents lower to governed `world_ops` records; commits append to an app-held operation log, mark dirty chunks, and form deterministic CPU field-preview products for scalar distance, vector gradient, occupancy, and material channels. Renderer/GPU overlays remain deferred to P3.

Exit criteria:

- users can create, edit, reorder, disable, preview, and commit SDF operations;
- SDF operation changes invalidate affected field products through `domain/world_ops`;
- preview surfaces show distance, normal/gradient, occupancy, and material-channel overlays.

### P2 - Procedural Material and Texture Foundation

Deliver material graph and texture domain contracts before broad feature breadth.

Exit criteria:

- `domain/material_graph` and `domain/texture` exist with ratifiers and formed product descriptors;
- PBR parameters, triplanar mapping, procedural nodes, Texture2D, Texture3D, and generated texture cache metadata are representable;
- first-slice material graphs can be authored, ratified, lowered, previewed, and rejected with source-mapped diagnostics;
- material graph lowering produces source maps and diagnostics.

Status after the 2026-05-09 descriptor-first closeout: the material/texture domain contract foundation and provider surfaces exist. Authored material documents are still not persisted/imported through a full document UX, material previews are descriptor-first rather than rendered, Texture3D viewers expose typed slice/mip/channel preview descriptors without GPU upload, and source-mapped diagnostics are projected through editor surfaces without making canvas state authoritative.

### P3 - SDF/Field Texturing and PBR Preview

Connect material products to SDF/field previews and render feature contributions.

Exit criteria:

- material previews can render SDF primitives and field products;
- triplanar mapping works against SDF/world coordinates;
- procedural textures can be generated or cached;
- PBR parameter changes hot reload safely into preview when the preview capability matrix permits it.

### P4 - Procedural World Generation

Deliver seed-driven generator documents and bounded preview/bake workflows.

Exit criteria:

- a generator graph can form deterministic world operation windows;
- bounded preview and bake-to-world workflows exist;
- invalidation and rebuild diagnostics show changed regions and products.

### P5 - Particles and VFX

Deliver particle emitter documents, particle graph authoring, SDF/field collision, and preview.

Exit criteria:

- emitters can spawn from SDF surfaces and field volumes;
- particle products can preview in editor surfaces;
- authored particle documents are unchanged by CPU/GPU backend choice;
- runtime diagnostics expose counts, bounds, and missing field-product readiness.

### P6 - Physics and Collision Authoring

Deliver physics domain contracts, collision product formation, rigid/character authoring, and debug surfaces.

Exit criteria:

- physics authoring works for bodies, colliders, materials, layers, masks, constraints, and triggers;
- `world_sdf` collision readiness is visible in the editor;
- solver-specific runtime state does not leak into `domain/physics` authored documents or formed products;
- simulation preview does not mutate authored documents without explicit commands.

### P7 - Animation and Procedural Motion

Deliver animation clips, curves, timeline, state/blend graphs, and SDF/world-aware procedural motion hooks.

Exit criteria:

- clips, curves, state machines, and blend trees can be authored and previewed;
- procedural motion can query SDF/world products through declared contracts;
- editor timeline, canvas, and panel state are omitted from formed animation products;
- animation events and root motion have source lineage and diagnostics.

### P8 - World Processes and Material Transport

Deliver simulation workflows for erosion, snow, water, sediment, accumulation, and material exchange.

Exit criteria:

- simulation preview layers are distinct from ratified authored layers;
- bake/commit creates governed world operations;
- rollback preserves authored layers and prior valid products;
- diagnostics expose changed regions, timescale class, solver budget, and product freshness.

### P9 - Integrated Procedural Production Workflow

Deliver a complete production loop across SDF modeling, procedural material/texturing, particles, physics, animation, world processes, runtime preview, and publishing.

Exit criteria:

- users can author a procedural scene from SDF geometry, procedural PBR materials, generated textures, particles, physics, animation, and world processes;
- every formed product has source lineage, diagnostics, cache/rebuild behavior, and hot reload boundaries;
- failed generation/import/lowering preserves the last valid product;
- full milestone validation gates pass.

## Editor Workspace Additions

Required workspace profiles:

- `SDF Modeling`;
- `Materials`;
- `Textures`;
- `Procedural Generation`;
- `Particles`;
- `Physics`;
- `Animation`;
- `Simulation`;
- `Debug`.

Required panels/tool surfaces:

- SDF Graph Canvas;
- SDF Brush Browser;
- Field Layer Stack;
- Field Product Viewer;
- Material Graph Canvas;
- Material Inspector;
- Material Preview;
- Texture Viewer;
- Texture3D/Volume Viewer;
- Procgen Graph Canvas;
- Procgen Preview;
- Particle Graph Canvas;
- Particle Preview;
- Physics Authoring;
- Physics Debug;
- Timeline;
- Curve Editor;
- Animation Graph Canvas;
- Simulation Preview;
- Simulation Diagnostics.

All of these must extend the shared provider and tool-surface framework. None should create a private side-channel interaction model.

## Procedural Workflow Doctrine

Procedural workflows are first-class authoring, not hidden runtime tricks.

Rules:

- procedural sources are authored assets with typed ids and revisions;
- seeds are explicit;
- random generation must be deterministic for fixed seed, inputs, and version;
- expensive procedural outputs are formed products with cache keys;
- generated products keep source lineage;
- preview layers are not silently promoted to authored truth;
- bake/commit workflows produce commands or world operations;
- runtime execution consumes formed products, not editor graph state;
- diagnostics must explain every rejected graph, failed generation, stale product, and unsupported target.

## Remaining Decision Gates

These are real decisions that must close at the named milestone. They are intentionally not open-ended roadmap items.

- P2: choose the first Texture3D GPU upload path, supported format set, and compression policy for editor preview. Domain descriptors must still represent unsupported formats with diagnostics.
- P2: choose the first material lowering target for previews: render expression product, shader fragment, or both. The authored graph contract must not depend on this choice.
- P3: choose the first PBR preview capability matrix for height/displacement, ambient occlusion, opacity/mask, and normal handling so unsupported outputs fail with explicit diagnostics.
- P4: choose the first procedural generation families to ship beyond the baseline first slice: terrain, cave, structure, or scatter.
- P5: choose whether the first runtime particle backend after CPU preview is GPU compute, indirect draw expansion, or CPU simulation with GPU upload. Authored particle documents must remain backend-neutral.
- P6: choose the first concrete physics runtime adapter or an in-house minimal solver. `domain/physics` remains solver-neutral either way.
- P7: choose the first skeletal pose/skeleton asset contract if skeletal assets become part of the first shipping workflow.
- P8: choose the first high-fidelity world-process family for production hardening: snow/sediment, water, or erosion.
- P9: choose final release-quality validation fixtures that cover a complete SDF-first procedural scene, including material, texture, procgen, particles, physics, animation, simulation, runtime preview, and failed-product recovery.

## Negative Doctrine

Do not:

- make material graphs mesh-first;
- make the viewport depend directly on material graphs, particle graphs, physics internals, or animation graphs;
- execute editor-authored semantic graphs directly as runtime authority;
- let generated textures or field products replace source assets without catalog ratification;
- treat Texture3D as just an image import without volume/sampler/color-space metadata;
- let particles, physics, animation, or world processes mutate authored world state through side channels;
- hide procedural seeds, versions, or source maps;
- make one universal procedural graph for materials, SDF, particles, animation, and physics.

## Validation Strategy

Each track needs tests for:

- structural graph validation;
- semantic ratification;
- deterministic lowering;
- source lineage preservation;
- cache key stability;
- failed product preservation;
- hot reload safety;
- viewport expression product display;
- command/ratification boundaries;
- domain ownership boundaries.

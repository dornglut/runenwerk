# Game Runtime UI Projection And HUD Platform

## Decision

`PT-GAME-RUNTIME-UI` is the runtime-proven production track for game-runtime UI
projection, HUD composition, view-model binding, validated game intents, runtime
UI expression submission, and SDF screen-HUD proof.

The track consumes the completed UI Designer contracts as design input. It does
not reopen `PT-UI-DESIGN`, does not make `PT-UI-LAB` a dependency, does not
expand `PT-UI-LAB`, and does not claim perfectionist verification. `PT-UI-LAB`
may be cited only as an evidence-pattern reference. A separate no-gap audit
intake must exist before any later `perfectionist_verified` claim.

The first roadmap row, `WR-104`, is governance only. It may update this design,
production planning, roadmap intake, code-truth matrices, and follow-on WR
candidates. It must not create `domain/game_ui`, edit engine runtime code, edit
SDF examples, or implement game UI behavior.

## Architecture Governance

The repository architecture-governance kickoff was run for this scope:

```text
Design roadmap intake for PT-GAME-RUNTIME-UI: a perfectionist game-runtime UI projection/HUD production track starting with governance only, no implementation
```

Governance findings for this design:

- DDD bounded context owner is unresolved by implementation and must be decided
  by accepted design or ADR before a game UI owner crate exists.
- Current generic UI definition owner remains `domain/ui/ui_definition`.
- Future game-runtime UI target extensions may live in `domain/game_ui`,
  `domain/game/interface`, or another accepted owner only after governance
  records dependency direction, source-of-truth boundaries, and fitness
  functions.
- `engine` owns runtime composition, frame preparation, render-flow execution,
  and UI expression submission. It does not own game semantics.
- Examples and apps own concrete proof state, proof view models, and application
  of accepted intents. UI projections must not mutate state directly.
- ADR need is deferred to the owner-boundary milestone. A new ADR or accepted
  design update is required before adding a game-runtime UI owner crate,
  changing dependency direction, or making projection output authoritative.
- ATAM-lite priority order: ownership/correctness first, fail-closed diagnostics
  second, runtime evidence third, author/developer ergonomics fourth,
  performance fifth.
- Team Topologies label: stream-aligned game runtime product work with
  complicated-subsystem support from `domain/ui`, engine render/runtime, and
  example/app evidence owners.

## Governing Invariants

- UI definitions are source truth only for UI/interface structure.
- UI definitions may bind only to read-only domain-owned view-model packets.
- UI definitions may emit validated intent proposals only.
- UI definitions must not mutate gameplay, render, runtime, scene, simulation,
  save-game, network, or project truth.
- Game-runtime UI projection must not depend on `domain/editor/editor_shell`,
  Workbench host policy, editor command routing, or editor provider vocabulary.
- Runtime/app/provider layers consume derived projection output and must not
  become canonical UI/interface truth.
- Engine UI submission is expression infrastructure, not game semantic
  authority.
- Unsupported target-profile features, denied capabilities, missing view-model
  packages, stale data, invalid intents, and unsafe editor/game coupling fail
  closed with typed diagnostics.

### App-neutral composition boundary

The accepted composition design provides reusable structure without promoting
game HUD or world-space semantics into the current cutover:

```text
GameViewportTarget -> PresentationTarget profile
GameScreen / HudRoot -> future app-owned composition definition
HudRegion -> future region profile
HudInstance -> future MountedContentRef profile
```

This does not resolve the future game-domain owner and does not authorize
`domain/game_ui`, world-space UI, or runtime implementation. Concrete
game state, entity anchors, culling, occlusion, input policy, and gameplay
commands remain outside generic UI. Game runtime work must not consume editor
workspace/tool-surface vocabulary.

## Current Code Truth

- `engine/examples/sdf_render_flow/runtime/app.rs::update_sdf_view_and_animation_system`
  currently projects the selected SDF view mode into `WindowState` title text.
  That is app chrome, not a game UI surface.
- `engine/examples/sdf_render_flow/rendering/graph.rs::build_render_flow`
  currently ends in terminal `present_pass("sdf.present")`. A later UI proof
  must copy scene color into `surface.color` and run the built-in UI composite
  pass after the scene output.
- `engine/src/plugins/render/runtime/ui_submission.rs::collect_runtime_ui_frame_submissions_system`
  currently collects hardcoded scene overlay and debug metrics producers. A
  later runtime UI slice must provide typed, deterministic producer registration
  and ordering without adding game semantics to engine render code.
- `engine/src/plugins/debug_metrics/mod.rs::debug_metrics_overlay_system`
  is diagnostics UI. It may provide metrics source evidence, but game HUD must
  not be implemented by reusing the debug overlay frame.
- `domain/ui/ui_widgets/src/tabs.rs::tabs`,
  `domain/ui/ui_runtime/src/runtime/ui_runtime.rs::UiRuntime`, and
  `UiInteraction::TabSelected` already provide retained UI substrate that the
  SDF proof should consume through accepted target projection and intent
  boundaries.

## Target Runtime Flow

```text
Authored UI definition or accepted proof fixture
  -> Canonical UI IR
  -> game-runtime target projection plan
  -> read-only game/runtime view-model packet
  -> retained UI runtime frame
  -> engine UI expression submission
  -> validated game intent proposal
  -> owning domain/app/example applies mutation
```

The SDF proof is the first runtime evidence target, not the architecture owner.
It must prove screen HUD and control behavior without implementing
world-space/entity-attached UI.

## Production Slices

- `PM-GAME-RUNTIME-UI-001`: governance, owner boundary, code-truth matrix, and
  follow-on WR candidates.
- `PM-GAME-RUNTIME-UI-002`: accepted game-runtime target extension contract and
  owner decision.
- `PM-GAME-RUNTIME-UI-003`: read-only view-model and validated intent contract
  activation.
- `PM-GAME-RUNTIME-UI-004`: generic runtime UI expression submission.
- `PM-GAME-RUNTIME-UI-005`: SDF screen HUD runtime proof.
- `PM-GAME-RUNTIME-UI-006`: evidence, docs, API ergonomics, and hardening.
- `PM-GAME-RUNTIME-UI-007`: runtime-proven closeout and perfectionist-audit
  intake.

World-space and screen-projected attachment UI is deferred to
`PT-GAME-WORLDSPACE-UI`. Nameplates, damage numbers, boss frames,
entity-attached widgets, and split-screen attachment contracts must wait for
explicit authored binding contracts, viewport/projection readiness, renderer
readiness where needed, and runtime formation seams.

## Evidence Rules

Descriptor-only, title-text-only, debug-overlay-only, or screenshot-free claims
are insufficient for runtime-proven game UI.

Runtime proof must show that:

- FPS/status and tab controls render in-frame through UI composition;
- window title no longer carries interactive game UI state;
- UI tab selection emits a validated intent proposal;
- the SDF/example state owner applies the accepted intent;
- UI producer ordering is deterministic across game HUD, scene overlay, and
  debug overlay submissions;
- render-flow pass shape includes scene color copy to `surface.color` followed
  by UI composite;
- diagnostics are typed for unsupported target features, denied capabilities,
  missing view-model data, stale data, invalid intents, and unsafe coupling.

## Stop Conditions

- A slice creates `domain/game_ui` or equivalent before accepted owner-boundary
  design or ADR.
- A UI projection mutates domain, runtime, render, scene, gameplay, save-game,
  network, or project truth directly.
- Engine render code starts owning game HUD semantics.
- SDF proof changes become the architecture instead of a bounded consumer proof.
- World-space/screen-projected attachment UI is folded into the first screen HUD
  proof instead of `PT-GAME-WORLDSPACE-UI`.
- The track claims `perfectionist_verified` before a separate completed no-gap
  audit with empty known gaps.

## Validation

Governance validation:

```text
task production:render
task production:validate
task production:check
task roadmap:render
task roadmap:validate
task roadmap:check
task planning:validate
task puml:validate
task docs:validate
```

Later implementation rows must add focused crate tests for target-profile
compatibility, fail-closed diagnostics, view-model/intent behavior, engine UI
submission ordering, SDF render-flow UI composite shape, and in-frame HUD proof.

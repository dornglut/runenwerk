# Live UiPlugin Runtime Full Platform Cutover Plan

ID: `PT-UI-RUNTIME-PLATFORM-002`

Lifecycle state: `active-planning` full-platform cutover contract draft.

Implementation status: not started and not authorized by this planning PR.

## Purpose

This document turns the accepted `PT-UI-RUNTIME-PLATFORM-001` direction into a complete implementation program. The next step is a full cutover contract that is then executed through bounded implementation PRs.

Required position:

```text
Plan the whole Live UiPlugin Runtime Platform cutover now.
Implement it through gated phase PRs.
Do not start runtime Rust work from this docs-only planning PR.
```

## Critical review result for this PR

This hardened plan makes these corrections:

```text
1. Replace transitional-producer language with complete superseded-path retirement requirements.
2. Remove short-term Counter-first framing; Counter must exercise the canonical long-term path.
3. Require a runnable runtime Counter app product, not only an abstract proof.
4. Require agent-controllable and machine-testable operation, not only human clicking.
5. Define trace/history as a phased UI-runtime subsystem, not Counter logging and not an engine-wide framework extraction.
6. Move producer-generic surface-frame semantics before UiPlugin render publication so new code does not stabilize on non-target UI-specific render ownership names.
7. Add render/app-engine feature mapping and move architecture/PlantUML diagrams into architecture docs.
8. State authoring, reload, persistence, SDF-backend, and phase-spec decisions instead of leaving them implicit.
9. Make each phase decision-complete enough for a simple implementation agent to follow without inventing architecture.
```

## Architecture ownership

Architecture and PlantUML diagrams live in architecture docs, not only in this planning file:

```text
docs-site/src/content/docs/architecture/live-uiplugin-runtime-platform-architecture.md
docs-site/src/content/docs/architecture/diagrams/live-uiplugin-runtime-platform.puml
docs-site/src/content/docs/architecture/diagrams/live-uiplugin-runtime-sequence.puml
```

This planning file owns phase sequencing and gates. The architecture doc owns current rendering facts, app/engine flow, producer-generic render-boundary decision, SDF-backend deferral, agent operation, tracing/history, Counter screen contract, authoring, live reload, state persistence, phase-spec decision, and diagram source.

## Implementation-documentation authorities checked

| Authority | How this plan uses it |
|---|---|
| `workspace/workflow-lifecycle.md` | Keeps this PR in planning, not implementation. |
| `workspace/complete-investigation-gate.md` | Inherits PR #74 investigation and adds render/app-engine feature mapping. |
| `workspace/complete-design-gate.md` | Requires owner, dependency, validation, stop-condition, and acceptance criteria before implementation. |
| `workspace/complete-merge-readiness-gate.md` | Defines the report shape every implementation PR must satisfy. |
| `workspace/evidence-quality-taxonomy.md` | Separates connector/source/planning evidence from local command validation. |
| `guidelines/programming-principles.md` | Enforces KISS/DRY/YAGNI/SOLID/separation constraints in every phase. |
| `architecture/ui-framework-architecture.md` | Keeps source/program/runtime/render ownership separated. |
| `architecture/live-uiplugin-runtime-platform-architecture.md` | Owns runtime-specific architecture, render-boundary ordering, SDF-backend deferral, diagrams, agent/trace model, Counter contract, reload, persistence, and phase-spec decisions. |
| `design/active/live-uiplugin-runtime-and-surface-frame-rendering-design.md` | Supplies the accepted target API and runtime/render boundary. |
| `reports/investigations/live-uiplugin-runtime-current-state-investigation.md` | Supplies current-state source facts and gaps. |
| `reports/closeouts/pt-ui-framework-app-integration-002-closeout.md` | Keeps `ui_app_integration` proof-local, not the final framework owner. |

Local command validation was not run in this connector-only planning session. Do not claim local validation until an agent runs it.

## Accepted basis

Authority comes from `PT-UI-RUNTIME-PLATFORM-001`:

```text
engine-owned UiPlugin runtime layer
reuse existing domain/ui contracts
app.mount_ui(Screen) as the normal app-authoring path
typed UiScreen / IntoUi / UiActionHandler / TryUiActionHandler
host-owned mutation through ui_hosts-compatible boundaries
mounted surface/session state through ui_surface-compatible boundaries
runtime/evaluator-backed output
producer-generic surface-frame render submission
RenderPlugin consumes producer frame data without owning UI semantics
```

Counter is the first product proof of that canonical path. It is not allowed to use a shortcut path.

## Superseded runtime policy

Final merged runtime-platform code must not contain superseded UI runtime paths, permanent adapters, or compatibility modules.

Allowed during implementation:

```text
short-lived migration code inside a branch before merge
comparison tests that prove prior behavior was replaced
explicit replacement/retirement of hardcoded render-owned UI producer paths
```

Not allowed in merged phase results:

```text
engine/src/plugins/ui/compat_*.rs
public APIs for prior manual add_ui_* registration chains
parallel prior and target UI runtime paths
RenderPlugin-owned UI semantic producer collection
permanent aliases without a retirement phase
```

If replacing a prior path requires temporary scaffolding, that scaffolding must be gone before the phase merges or the PR must stay draft.

## Global invariants

| Invariant | Rule |
|---|---|
| Engine owns app/plugin composition | `engine::plugins::ui` may integrate with `App` and `Plugin`; domain UI crates must not depend on engine. |
| Domain UI owns UI semantics | Source, program, surface, host, evaluator, runtime-view, and frame contracts stay in existing domain crates unless a phase proves a small ownership adjustment. |
| App/host owns mutation | Generic UI controls, renderer code, and domain UI contracts must not mutate app state directly. |
| Render consumes producer output | RenderPlugin may consume producer/surface/frame facts; it must not own `UiScreen`, `IntoUi`, action routing, host mutation, or source/program semantics. |
| Public API stays ergonomic | Normal app authors use `app.mount_ui(Screen)` and typed handlers, not route maps, event packets, host adapters, or render registries. |
| Agent and human use the same route path | Agent scripts and human input must both pass through route, capability, payload, and host checks. |
| Trace is generic UI runtime infrastructure | Action history must be a generic UI-runtime trace, not Counter-specific print statements and not an engine-wide tracing framework extraction. |
| Superseded paths are retired | Scene/debug/render-owned UI collection must migrate into the new producer model or be intentionally retired. |
| Genericization happens before publication | The producer-generic surface-frame seam must exist before UiPlugin publishes durable runtime frames. |
| Counter app is runnable | The cutover is not complete until `cargo run -p ui_counter_runtime` starts an interactive app and an agent can drive the same semantics headlessly. |
| SDF has a downstream owner | SDF UI backend work belongs to `PT-UI-RENDER-BACKEND-SDF-001` after the runtime product path is proven. |
| Specs are handoff contracts, not new authority | Phase specs may be introduced as machine-checkable implementation contracts, but they must derive from accepted docs and must not become a parallel source of truth. |

## Render/app-engine feature matrix

| Area | Required platform feature | Current known source/authority | Missing / implementation work |
|---|---|---|---|
| App composition | Install `RenderPlugin`, `UiPlugin`, app plugin | Engine `App` / `Plugin` model exists | Add `engine::plugins::ui` and prelude/export decisions. |
| Public mounting | `app.mount_ui(Screen)` and `app.ui().mount(Screen)` | Accepted target API in PR #74 design | Implement extension, diagnostics, mount request storage. |
| Typed source | `UiScreen` / `IntoUi` lower to source/program facts | `ui_definition`, `ui_program`, `ui_program_lowering` authority | Implement engine-facing facade without duplicating domain semantics. |
| Typed actions | `UiActionHandler` / `TryUiActionHandler` mutate host-owned state | `ui_hosts`, `ui_app_integration` proof evidence | Implement typed dispatch, failure taxonomy, no-mutation negatives. |
| Mounted sessions | Surface/session identity, host identity, generation, retention | `ui_surface` authority | Wrap in engine resources without inventing another surface model. |
| Input to action | Pointer, keyboard, and agent-script events reach mounted UI through the same route/capability path | Current engine input and winit path exist; route integration is missing | Implement the canonical runtime event-to-action pipeline, with Counter as first proof and no shortcut. |
| Runtime trace | Route, capability, action, mutation, and diagnostics first; evaluation/frame/source/state events added by their owning phases | Render diagnostics/tracing exist; UI runtime trace does not | Add generic `UiRuntimeTrace` resource, JSONL export, and console view without extracting an engine-wide framework. |
| Runtime output | Source/program/evaluator facts produce runtime-view output | `ui_evaluator`, `ui_runtime_view` | Wire mounted screen evaluation and report output facts. |
| Invalidation | Redraw only when dirty for non-animated UI; continuous policy remains for animation | Current frame pacing supports continuous and on-demand; current UI submission replaces whole producer/surface frame | Add generic dirty/invalidation records before claiming optimized redraw. |
| Producer-generic surface frame | Runtime producers publish producer/surface/frame packets without UI-specific render ownership names | Current render submission seam is UI-named | Generalize the producer-facing submission seam before UiPlugin render publication. |
| Render publication | Render consumes producer/surface frame facts | Existing render submission resources | UiPlugin publishes through the generic seam; RenderPlugin must not query screens/actions/host state. |
| Prior render UI producers | Hardcoded scene/debug overlay collection | Current render runtime investigation from PR #74 | Replace/retire hardcoded producer path through the generic producer seam; no permanent compatibility module. |
| Runnable product | User can start and interact with Counter app | Target product not present yet | Add `apps/ui_counter_runtime` with human and agent operation. |
| Source reload | Data-backed UI source revisions can reload without a second runtime architecture | Rust/RON/designer source model exists architecturally; live reload is not proven | Add source revision/reload policy for RON/designer/source IR; do not claim Rust hot reload. |
| State persistence | Host/app state and UI session state persist through explicit owner hooks | App resources and replay APIs exist; no generic UI persistence contract yet | Add host-owned state snapshot/load and UI session snapshot/replay rules after the product path exists. |
| SDF UI backend | Analytical SDF primitive backend is a downstream render/projection track | SDF is not current UI semantic owner | Defer to `PT-UI-RENDER-BACKEND-SDF-001`; do not implement in this cutover. |
| Product proof | Automated evidence proves app path | `ui_app_integration` proof-local tests | Add live runtime proof through public API, not proof-local bridge. |
| Phase spec | Machine-checkable handoff contract | Workflow supports exact contracts but has no spec artifact yet | Add as downstream workflow hardening or first implementation-prompt artifact, not as a PR #76 blocker. |

## Authoring, reload, persistence, and spec decisions

Authoring decisions:

```text
Counter product primary authoring path: Rust typed `UiScreen` / `IntoUi` through app.mount_ui.
Source truth: everything still lowers to ui_definition / UiProgram facts.
RON/template source: supported as data-backed source frontend and downstream live-reload target.
Visual designer output: downstream source IR producer, not a renderer-primitive producer.
Rust hot reload: not claimed.
```

Reload decision:

```text
Live UI changes are data-source revision changes, not dynamic Rust code reload.
A reload must revalidate, re-lower, recompile/evaluate, and preserve session state only by stable source/runtime IDs.
Reload failures are diagnostic-bearing and must not leave stale UI success claims.
```

Persistence decision:

```text
App/domain state is host-owned and persists only through explicit host snapshot/load hooks.
UI session state may be snapshotted/replayed for tests and restored by stable IDs.
Render cache state is not user/application persistence.
Counter product persistence is enabled only after the named persistence contract exists.
```

Phase-spec decision:

```text
Human design authority remains Markdown.
A phase implementation spec may be introduced as a compact RON handoff contract.
A phase spec must derive from accepted docs and must not become a parallel authority.
JSONL remains the required trace output format for agents and CI.
Spec adoption is downstream workflow hardening, not a blocker for PR #76.
```

## Runtime trace, agent operation, and console

Agent operation is a first-class product requirement.

Required command shapes:

```text
cargo run -p ui_counter_runtime
cargo run -p ui_counter_runtime -- --headless --agent-script assets/ui_counter_runtime/scripts/increment_reset.ron --trace-jsonl target/ui_counter_runtime/trace.jsonl --exit-after-script
cargo test -p ui_counter_runtime
```

Trace taxonomy authority lives in `architecture/live-uiplugin-runtime-platform-architecture.md`.

Phase 007 implements only the first action-path trace subset:

```text
UiRuntimeMounted
UiInputObserved
UiRouteProposed
UiCapabilityChecked
UiActionDispatched
UiHostMutationApplied
UiHostMutationRejected
UiRuntimeDiagnostic
```

Later phases add the event families they own:

```text
Phase 008: runtime evaluation, state/invalidation, optional session-restore trace facts
Phase 010: frame publication and frame presentation trace facts
Phase 013: source revision, source lowering, program formation, and state-snapshot trace facts
```

Trace requirements:

```text
bounded in-memory ring buffer resource
machine-readable JSONL export
human-readable console/debug surface in the Counter product
source-map awareness where source identity exists
same trace path for human and agent input
no direct Counter mutation by agent scripts
```

## Runtime Counter product screen contract

The product screen contract is owned by `architecture/live-uiplugin-runtime-platform-architecture.md` and must be consumed by Phase 012.

Required product identity:

```text
binary: ui_counter_runtime
window title: Runenwerk UI Counter Runtime
mounted screen type: CounterScreen
host plugin type: CounterPlugin
host resource: Counter { value: i64 }
initial value: 0 unless loaded from explicit host-owned state file after the persistence phase exists
```

Required visible structure:

```text
root surface: CounterScreen
root layout: vertical stack or equivalent semantic container
header label: Runenwerk UI Counter Runtime
count label: Count: {value}
action row: Increment, Decrement, Reset
trace console: last N runtime trace entries, newest last or clearly ordered
status line: last action result or diagnostic summary
```

Required routes and host mutations:

```text
counter.increment -> counter.write -> Counter.value += 1
counter.decrement -> counter.write -> Counter.value -= 1
counter.reset -> counter.write -> Counter.value = 0
counter.read -> rendering current count
```

The screen must not expose route maps, event packets, host adapters, or render registries to normal app authors.

## Per-phase contracts

### Phase 003 — UiPlugin Foundation

Allowed scope:

```text
engine/src/plugins/ui/mod.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/plugin.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/schedule.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/resources.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/report.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/diagnostics.rs
engine/src/plugins/mod.rs
engine/Cargo.toml only if justified
focused engine tests for plugin installation/resource initialization
```

Required evidence:

```text
UiPlugin installs without panicking
plugin install is idempotent or reports duplicate install deterministically
resources have stable default state
schedule labels exist without render/backend ownership changes
```

Stop if this requires `foundation/meta`, `domain/app_program`, a generic plugin framework, domain UI depending on engine, or a render backend rewrite.

### Phase 004 — App Mounting API

Allowed scope:

```text
engine/src/plugins/ui/app_ext.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/mount.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/resources.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/diagnostics.rs
engine/src/prelude.rs if accepted for public export
focused engine tests/examples proving app.mount_ui and app.ui().mount compile
```

Required evidence:

```text
normal path records a mount request without manual surface factory setup
advanced path records the same mount request with explicit configuration/reporting hooks
mount diagnostics include screen identity, mount source, and stable failure reason
normal users are not exposed to route maps, event packets, host adapters, or render registries
```

Stop if the common path needs manual host adapters, manual route maps, manual render submission writes, or private App internals that are not part of the accepted engine API.

### Phase 005 — Typed Screen / Source / Action Contracts

Allowed scope:

```text
engine/src/plugins/ui/screen.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/source.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/action.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/host.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/diagnostics.rs
engine/Cargo.toml dependency additions for selected domain/ui crates
focused engine tests plus comparison evidence from ui_app_integration where useful
```

Required evidence:

```text
typed screen lowers to ui_definition-compatible source records
typed source produces route/source-map facts
typed action handler emits host-owned mutation intent
action identity is stable and diagnostic-friendly
ui_app_integration remains proof evidence, not final framework owner
```

Stop if typed UI skips source/program facts, if generic controls mutate app state directly, or if a new broad runtime-platform domain crate becomes necessary.

### Phase 006 — Mounted Surface Session Runtime

Allowed scope:

```text
engine/src/plugins/ui/resources.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/mount.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/report.rs
engine/Cargo.toml dependency on ui_surface if not already present
focused engine tests for mount/unmount/generation/session reports
```

Required evidence:

```text
mount creates a MountedSurfaceInstance-compatible record
session identity, host identity, generation, retention, and diagnostics are recorded
unmount/remount behavior is deterministic
multiple mounted screens/surfaces do not collide
no duplicate surface/session semantic model is invented inside engine
```

Stop if this requires world-space UI, SDF, SpatialCanvas, product/editor/game semantics in domain UI, or replacing `ui_surface` instead of adapting to it.

### Phase 007 — Host Action Dispatch and Runtime Trace

Allowed scope:

```text
engine/src/plugins/ui/events.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/action.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/host.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/report.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/diagnostics.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/trace.rs
engine/Cargo.toml dependency on ui_hosts if not already present
focused positive and negative engine tests
```

Required evidence:

```text
known action mutates only through app/host owner
unknown route does not mutate
schema mismatch does not mutate
capability mismatch does not mutate
payload mismatch does not mutate
missing host data does not mutate
action report records route/action/host/failure reason
generic UI-runtime trace records mounted/input/route/capability/dispatch/mutation/rejection/diagnostic events
```

Stop if errors become silent, partial mutation is possible on invalid input, product/editor/game semantics move into generic UI, trace is Counter-specific, or trace extraction becomes an engine-wide framework.

### Phase 008 — Runtime Evaluation, State Snapshot, and Invalidation

Allowed scope:

```text
engine/src/plugins/ui/source.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/resources.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/report.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/diagnostics.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/trace.rs
engine/Cargo.toml dependencies on selected evaluator/runtime-view/render-data crates
focused engine tests for output facts, state snapshots, dirty records, and frame payload creation
```

Required evidence:

```text
mounted screen source/program facts feed evaluator/runtime-view path
Counter output text changes after host mutation
frame payload is derived from runtime/evaluator output
runtime report includes source, program, runtime-view, output, diagnostics, and invalidation facts
UI session snapshot/replay is stable by source/runtime IDs
dirty records name source, host-data, session, layout, text, theme, primitive, surface, and render-publication causes
trace adds runtime evaluation and state/invalidation facts
```

Stop if frame output skips source/program/evaluator evidence, a new execution strategy is invented without accepted design, renderer primitives become UI source truth, or per-element incremental rendering is claimed without dirty-scope proof.

### Phase 009 — SurfaceFrame Generic Producer Boundary

Allowed scope:

```text
only the render frame/submission contracts named by the phase PR
only ui_render_data names/types touched by the accepted migration map
existing render submission registry/resource paths required for the generic producer seam
focused migration tests and compile checks
```

Required evidence:

```text
migration map lists every renamed type/module/function
producer-generic names replace UI-specific render ownership at the accepted seam before UiPlugin publishes durable frames
producer id and surface identity are generic concepts, not UiPlugin concepts
RenderPlugin consumes generic producer/surface/frame packets
scene/debug paths remain named as migration inputs, not hidden parallel paths
external docs no longer imply RenderPlugin owns UI semantics
```

Stop if the rename becomes broad/unreviewable, source/program/action semantics change, the phase becomes a render backend rewrite, or genericization creates a second runtime path.

### Phase 010 — UiPlugin Render Publication

Allowed scope:

```text
engine/src/plugins/ui/render_publish.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/report.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/trace.rs
existing generic render submission registry/resource paths only where needed
focused engine/render integration tests
```

Required evidence:

```text
UiPlugin publishes frame submission with producer id and surface identity through the generic seam
RenderPlugin consumes prepared payload without querying UiScreen, IntoUi, actions, host mutation, or route policy
render contribution is deterministic for the same runtime frame
missing UiPlugin frame reports a diagnostic instead of silent success
frame publication trace records producer, surface, frame revision, dirty cause, and publication result
```

Stop if RenderPlugin becomes the UI runtime owner, pulls from app host state directly, or needs a broad backend rewrite.

### Phase 011 — Scene/Debug Overlay Producer Migration and Retirement

Allowed scope:

```text
specific existing render collection paths identified by the phase investigation
engine/src/plugins/ui/** only if the new UiPlugin producer path needs migration helpers that are gone before merge
focused tests proving existing scene/debug overlay behavior through the generic producer path or proving intentional retirement
```

Required evidence:

```text
every prior hardcoded scene/debug UI producer path is named
replacement path is named or retirement is justified
no compat_*.rs modules remain after merge
no prior manual UI registration path remains public
RenderPlugin no longer owns UI semantic producer collection
```

Stop if the PR leaves parallel prior/target runtime paths, changes unrelated render behavior, or creates a second UI runtime.

### Phase 012 — Runtime Counter App Product

Allowed scope:

```text
apps/ui_counter_runtime/**
root Cargo.toml workspace member entry
focused engine tests/examples for Counter app
engine/src/plugins/ui/** fixes only if required by product proof and scoped
planning docs and proof report fixtures
```

Required evidence:

```text
cargo run -p ui_counter_runtime starts the human app
cargo run -p ui_counter_runtime -- --headless --agent-script <script> --trace-jsonl <path> --exit-after-script runs agent mode
cargo test -p ui_counter_runtime proves the app path
app installs RenderPlugin, UiPlugin, and CounterPlugin
CounterPlugin uses app.mount_ui(CounterScreen)
CounterScreen implements the accepted typed screen/source/action model and the architecture-owned product screen contract
UI exposes increment, decrement, and reset actions
human interaction and agent scripts use the same route/capability/payload checks
user/agent interaction mutates Counter only through host-owned path
runtime/evaluator output changes after mutation
UiPlugin publishes through the generic producer/surface-frame seam
RenderPlugin consumes the submission without UI semantic ownership
console/history view shows recent generic UI-runtime trace events
JSONL trace records action, mutation, evaluation, and frame publication facts
manual run instructions and observed behavior are recorded in the PR
```

Stop if the proof cannot show source/program/runtime/action/mutation/render facts, if it needs proof-local `ui_app_integration` as the public runtime owner, if agent mode mutates host state directly, or if the product cannot be launched by command.

### Phase 013 — Source Reload and Persistence Contract

Allowed scope:

```text
engine/src/plugins/ui/source.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/resources.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/report.rs
engine/src/plugins/ui/trace.rs
focused tests for source revision reload and session restore
optional product fixture files for RON/source-IR reload proof if accepted
optional ui_counter_runtime state-file support if scoped to host-owned persistence demonstration
```

Required evidence:

```text
source revision IDs are stable and traceable
RON/template or source-IR reload revalidates and re-lowers through ui_definition / UiProgram
reload failure leaves prior valid runtime state or reports deterministic failure without stale success
UI session state restores only by stable IDs and reports dropped state
host-owned app state persistence hooks are explicit and not owned by generic UI controls
trace adds source revision, source lowering, program formation, and state-snapshot facts
```

Stop if Rust code hot reload is claimed, reload bypasses source/program validation, generic UI silently persists app/domain state, or persistence becomes a renderer/cache concern.

### Phase 014 — Closeout and Adoption Lock

Allowed scope:

```text
docs-site/src/content/docs/reports/closeouts/**
docs-site/src/content/docs/workspace/planning/active-work.md
docs-site/src/content/docs/workspace/planning/roadmap.md
docs-site/src/content/docs/workspace/planning/production-tracks.md
docs-site/src/content/docs/workspace/planning/decision-register.md
owning design docs only for final truth and known gaps
```

Required evidence:

```text
all implementation phase PRs and merge commits are recorded
final validation commands and results are recorded
remaining gaps are explicit
next-track activation is explicit
superseded paths are gone or explicitly documented as intentionally retired
agent/human Counter product evidence is recorded
SDF backend track activation condition is recorded without being implemented in this cutover
phase-spec workflow hardening decision is recorded without becoming parallel authority
```

Stop if final validation cannot be proven, planning truth disagrees with merged code, or next implementation starts before closeout truth is recorded.

## Cross-phase dependency graph

The dependency graph is maintained as PlantUML in:

```text
docs-site/src/content/docs/architecture/diagrams/live-uiplugin-runtime-platform.puml
docs-site/src/content/docs/architecture/diagrams/live-uiplugin-runtime-sequence.puml
```

Execution order:

```text
003 UiPlugin foundation
  -> 004 App mounting API
  -> 005 Typed screen/source/action contracts
  -> 006 Mounted surface/session runtime
  -> 007 Host action dispatch and runtime trace
  -> 008 Runtime evaluation, state snapshot, and invalidation
  -> 009 SurfaceFrame generic producer boundary
  -> 010 UiPlugin render publication
  -> 011 Scene/debug overlay producer migration/retirement
  -> 012 Runtime Counter app product
  -> 013 Source reload and persistence contract
  -> 014 Closeout and adoption lock
```

Downstream named tracks that must not be implemented in this cutover:

```text
PT-UI-RENDER-BACKEND-SDF-001 — Analytical SDF UI Primitive Backend
Workflow hardening item — phase implementation spec artifact and validator
```

## Validation envelope

Every implementation phase must run the smallest focused crate/test set required by its scope plus docs and diff hygiene. The default final gate is:

```text
cargo test -p engine <focused phase tests>
phase-owned domain crate tests when touched or depended on
cargo test --workspace before broad runtime/render migration or final product proof
python tools/docs/validate_docs.py
git diff --check
git status --short --branch
git diff --stat main...HEAD
```

Phase 012 must additionally record:

```text
cargo run -p ui_counter_runtime
cargo run -p ui_counter_runtime -- --headless --agent-script <script> --trace-jsonl <path> --exit-after-script
cargo test -p ui_counter_runtime
```

Do not claim validation that was not run.

## Merge-readiness report shape

Every implementation PR must report:

```text
branch/head SHA
base SHA or refreshed-from-main status
exact files changed
exact modules/functions/sections changed
validation commands run and results
proof/evidence artifacts added
trace/history evidence where relevant
superseded-path migration/retirement status where relevant
stop conditions checked
known blockers and deferrals
next phase recommendation
```

## Handoff contract for a simple implementation agent

A simple implementation agent must receive exactly one phase at a time. The prompt must include:

```text
phase ID and title
authority docs to read, including AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, DOMAIN_MAP.md, TESTING.md, workflow gates, active-work, roadmap, production-tracks, and the owning design/architecture docs
allowed files/crates
forbidden files/crates
expected public API shape
required tests/proofs
required docs updates
validation commands
stop conditions
instruction to stop rather than widen scope
```

The agent must not decide to add a generic plugin framework, revive `domain/app_program`, preserve superseded UI runtime paths, skip route/capability checks, invent Counter-specific tracing, extract an engine-wide tracing framework, claim Rust UI hot reload, implement SDF/world-space/SpatialCanvas, or publish new UiPlugin runtime frames through non-target UI-specific render ownership names as part of this runtime-platform cutover.

## Current planning PR acceptance criteria

This planning PR is acceptable when it records:

```text
full phase map from planning through closeout
per-phase purpose, allowed files/crates, evidence, validation, and stop conditions
global invariants
render/app-engine feature matrix
producer-generic surface-frame boundary before UiPlugin render publication
runnable Counter product requirement
Counter product screen contract authority
agent/headless operation requirement
phased generic UI-runtime trace/history/console requirement
source reload and persistence decisions
SDF UI backend explicitly excluded and assigned to PT-UI-RENDER-BACKEND-SDF-001
phase-spec workflow decision recorded as downstream hardening, not PR #76 implementation work
superseded-path migration/retirement policy
architecture docs and PlantUML sources outside this planning doc
explicit correction from first-slice-only planning to full-platform cutover planning
planning-file state transition to PT-UI-RUNTIME-PLATFORM-002
no runtime implementation
```

## Next action after this PR merges

Open `PT-UI-RUNTIME-PLATFORM-003 — UiPlugin Foundation` as the first implementation PR. That PR must stay inside Phase 003 boundaries and must not opportunistically implement the whole platform.

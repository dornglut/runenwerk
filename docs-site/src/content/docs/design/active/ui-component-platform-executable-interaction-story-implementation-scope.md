# UI Component Platform Executable Interaction Story Implementation Scope

## Status

Lifecycle state: `completed`.

Planning ID: `PT-UI-COMPONENT-PLATFORM-012A`.

This scope records the merged PR #43 evidence and cleanup boundary for the first Tier 5 executable interaction story proof-host core. PR #43 merged into `main` on 2026-06-30 at merge commit `c8b73dfa95fc335fd2b33c9137cac03a0f35060f`. User start condition for Phase 13 reports PR #43 was validated and merged.

The implementation uses durable base-controls names for public APIs, stable ids, tests, and implementation files. Phase or PR labels belong only in planning history, reports, and roadmap state.

Product-facing Gallery or editor-window exposure remains separate future work under `PT-UI-GALLERY-001`.

## Completed outcome

```text
one executable base-controls interaction story
  -> deterministic replay mode
  -> live proof-host mode fed by UiInputEvent / NormalizedInputSample
  -> shared runtime interaction formation after NormalizedInputSample
  -> semantic replay/live parity report
  -> InteractionVisualProof / InteractionProofRenderFrame
  -> UiStaticMountReport::from_frame
  -> zero host-command/product-mutation/overlay/text-edit boundary counters
```

The implementation did not create product behavior. It did not implement UI Gallery exposure, overlay/popup/layering, full text editing, product command execution, product mutation, shared plugin framework extraction, generic plugin primitives, or `foundation/meta`.

## Implemented files and crates

### `domain/ui/ui_story`

Implemented files:

```text
domain/ui/ui_story/src/workflow/builtin.rs
domain/ui/ui_story/src/workflow/mod.rs
domain/ui/ui_story/tests/executable_interaction_workflow.rs
```

Completed work:

- Added a built-in executable interaction workflow profile.
- Kept `ui_story` as workflow/evidence-envelope authority only.
- Did not make `ui_story` depend on runtime, controls, static mount, editor, or product crates.

### `domain/ui/ui_runtime`

Implemented files:

```text
domain/ui/ui_runtime/Cargo.toml
domain/ui/ui_runtime/src/input/generic_interaction.rs
domain/ui/ui_runtime/src/input/generic_interaction_fixture.rs
domain/ui/ui_runtime/src/input/generic_interaction_visual_frame.rs
domain/ui/ui_runtime/src/input/interaction_story_session.rs
domain/ui/ui_runtime/src/input/mod.rs
domain/ui/ui_runtime/tests/interaction_replay_report.rs
domain/ui/ui_runtime/tests/executable_interaction_story.rs
```

Durable public/runtime names:

```text
BASE_CONTROLS_GENERIC_INTERACTION_PROOF_ID
BASE_CONTROLS_EXECUTABLE_INTERACTION_STORY_ID
base_controls_generic_interaction_fixture
base_controls_generic_interaction_positive_script
base_controls_generic_interaction_negative_scripts
base_controls_generic_interaction_proof_frame
base_controls_executable_interaction_story_session
base_controls_executable_interaction_expected_evidence
InteractionStoryExecutionMode
InteractionStorySession
InteractionStoryRunReport
InteractionStoryStepEvidence
InteractionReplayLiveParityReport
```

Boundaries preserved:

- No phase-shaped public aliases or compatibility shims.
- No host command execution.
- No product/editor/game state mutation.
- No overlays, popups, dropdowns, tooltips, modals, or layering behavior.
- No full text editing, caret, selection, text buffer mutation, clipboard, undo/redo, or IME/composition behavior.
- No story registry/discovery authority moved into `ui_runtime`.
- No generic plugin framework, generic plugin primitives, `foundation/meta`, or shared plugin extraction.

### `domain/ui/ui_input`

Implemented files:

```text
domain/ui/ui_input/src/facts.rs
domain/ui/ui_input/src/event.rs
domain/ui/ui_input/src/lib.rs
domain/ui/ui_input/tests/input_normalized_facts.rs
```

Completed work:

- Added normalized input facts and minimal conversion helpers.
- Kept facts as data only.
- Did not add Button/List/Tree/Table/Inspector semantics to `ui_input`.

### `domain/ui/ui_static_mount`

Implemented files:

```text
domain/ui/ui_static_mount/src/lib.rs
domain/ui/ui_static_mount/Cargo.toml
domain/ui/ui_static_mount/tests/base_controls_generic_interaction_static_mount.rs
domain/ui/ui_static_mount/tests/base_controls_executable_interaction_story_static_mount.rs
```

Completed work:

- Reused `UiStaticMountReport::from_frame`.
- Validated base-controls generic/executable interaction proof frames.
- Did not move story execution or interaction semantics into `ui_static_mount`.

### `apps/runenwerk_editor`

Implemented files:

```text
apps/runenwerk_editor/Cargo.toml
apps/runenwerk_editor/src/editor_features/mod.rs
apps/runenwerk_editor/src/editor_features/base_controls_interaction_proof_host.rs
apps/runenwerk_editor/tests/base_controls_interaction_proof_host.rs
```

Durable editor-side proof-host name:

```text
BaseControlsInteractionProofHost
```

Completed work:

- Adapted existing `UiInputEvent` values to normalized samples.
- Fed samples into `InteractionStorySession`.
- Exposed current proof/frame/report/static-mount evidence for tests and future display.

Boundaries preserved:

- No editor command execution.
- No product/editor scene mutation.
- No overlay, popup, or text editing behavior.
- No editor shell surface registry changes for product-facing display in PR #43.

## Validation evidence

Completion evidence is recorded in planning from merged PR #43 plus the user validation report. The focused validation gate for the implementation was:

```text
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo check -p runenwerk_editor
cargo test -p runenwerk_editor base_controls_interaction_proof_host
cargo check -p ui_controls
cargo check -p ui_input
cargo check -p ui_runtime
cargo check -p ui_static_mount
cargo test -p ui_story executable_interaction_workflow
cargo test -p ui_controls control_interaction
cargo test -p ui_input input
cargo test -p ui_runtime executable_interaction_story
cargo test -p ui_runtime --test interaction_replay_report
cargo test -p ui_static_mount base_controls
python tools/docs/validate_docs.py
git diff --check
```

## Completion criteria

Implementation is complete because planning evidence records that:

- no current public API, stable id, reusable fixture helper, current test file, or active implementation-scope file uses phase-shaped names;
- no compatibility alias or hidden shim remains in the completed proof path;
- replay and live apply share the same runtime path after normalized input;
- semantic replay/live parity passes by user-reported validation;
- static mount validation passes from the current story frame by user-reported validation;
- boundary counters remain zero;
- docs accurately say product-facing Gallery exposure is separate future work.

## Retained stop conditions for later work

Stop and redesign if later work tries to reopen this scope to add product-facing gallery/shell surface registration, product commands, product mutation, overlays, full text editing, a parallel story runner, shared plugin framework extraction, generic plugin primitives, `foundation/meta`, or pixel-perfect replay/live parity.

## Relationship to Phase 13

Phase 13 overlay/popup/layering design must consume this executable interaction story standard. It must not introduce a parallel live proof host, fake overlay state outside runtime evidence, or bypass normalized input and semantic replay/live parity.

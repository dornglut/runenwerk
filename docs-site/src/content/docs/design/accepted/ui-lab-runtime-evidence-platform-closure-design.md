# UI Lab Runtime Evidence Platform Closure Design

## Status

Accepted for `PM-UI-LAB-PERF-002`.

This design clears the design gate for the runtime evidence platform closure
only. It does not authorize product code until a linked WR row is selected,
`task production:plan -- --milestone PM-UI-LAB-PERF-002 --roadmap WR-105`
produces an implementation contract, and roadmap promotion gates pass.

## Goal

Editor Lab V1 no-gap certification needs evidence results that are either
native runtime artifacts or explicit typed platform-impossible diagnostics.

The PM006 Preview Lab already records retained visual artifacts, diagnostics,
accessibility snapshots, performance snapshots, unsupported checks, reload,
apply, rollback, and degraded-provider proof. PM002 of the perfectionist track
does not replace that harness. It tightens the evidence platform so every
unsupported PM006 check is re-evaluated through a capability probe and recorded
as one of:

- captured native/runtime artifact;
- typed platform-impossible diagnostic with backend, environment, and reason;
- blocking failure.

## Current Code Truth

Current PM006 code and artifacts provide a useful base:

- `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/editor_lab_evidence/mod.rs` defines
  `EditorLabPreviewScenario`, `EditorLabEvidenceRun`,
  `EditorLabEvidenceArtifact`, accessibility/performance snapshots,
  unsupported-check diagnostics, and manifest validation.
- `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/tests.rs` test
  `pm_ui_lab_006_runtime_evidence_reports_preview_lab` executes app-hosted
  Editor Lab paths and writes closeout artifacts when
  `RUNENWERK_WRITE_PM_UI_LAB_006_EVIDENCE=1`.
- PM006 artifacts record unsupported diagnostics for
  `native_screenshot_capture`, `native_focus_traversal`,
  `pixel_contrast_sampling`, `native_screenshot_timing`, and
  `gpu_visual_diff_timing`.

No-gap blockers:

- `EditorLabEvidenceArtifactKind` does not yet distinguish native screenshot,
  GPU visual diff, focus traversal, contrast sample, or timing artifacts from
  retained/debug reports.
- Unsupported checks are free-form diagnostics, not the output of a typed
  capability probe.
- Manifest validation rejects descriptor-only evidence, but it does not yet
  require native-or-platform-impossible classification for no-gap targets.
- Focus, contrast, screenshot timing, and GPU visual-diff timing are recorded
  as unsupported in PM006 without a reusable platform-impossible result model.

## Architecture Governance

Governance result for PM002:

- DDD bounded context owner: `editor`.
- App owner: `apps/runenwerk_editor` owns runtime evidence execution,
  capability probes, artifact writing, native screenshot adapters,
  accessibility/focus inspection, contrast sampling, timing capture, and
  platform-impossible diagnostics.
- Supporting owner: `domain/editor/editor_shell` owns retained UI composition,
  route labels, disabled reasons, and app-neutral surface view models. It does
  not own evidence execution or artifact storage.
- Supporting owner: `domain/editor/editor_definition` remains runtime-neutral
  and may expose document ids or operation report data consumed by evidence.
- Supporting owner: `domain/ui/ui_definition` remains behavior-free. It may
  provide diagnostics and retained UI structures, but it must not execute
  scenarios, own native windows, write artifacts, or measure runtime
  performance.
- Renderer or windowing helpers may be consumed only through app-owned
  adapters. They must not become Editor Lab source truth.
- ADR need: no ADR is required while evidence execution stays app-owned and
  domain crates remain descriptor/report owners. Add an ADR or accepted design
  update before moving native capture, focus, contrast, timing, or visual diff
  ownership into a reusable cross-domain platform crate.
- ATAM-lite priority order: truthful evidence classification first,
  reproducibility second, user-visible runtime proof third, CI portability
  fourth, performance overhead fifth.
- Ownership mode: stream-aligned editor product work with
  complicated-subsystem support from app runtime/windowing and retained shell
  owners.

## Evidence Platform Contract

PM002 should extend the PM006 harness with typed no-gap evidence concepts.
Exact Rust names may change during implementation, but the contracts must keep
these semantics.

`EditorLabEvidenceCapability`
: Stable enum for no-gap evidence targets: native screenshot, GPU visual diff,
  native focus traversal, pixel contrast sampling, native screenshot timing,
  GPU visual-diff timing, diagnostics snapshot, degraded-provider snapshot,
  reload, apply, rollback, and failure-preservation proof.

`EditorLabEvidenceCapabilityProbe`
: App-owned probe result containing capability, backend/environment metadata,
  support status, and reason. This is the only source that may justify a
  platform-impossible result.

`EditorLabEvidenceResult`
: Typed result for one capability: `Captured`, `PlatformImpossible`, or
  `Failed`. Captured results include artifact paths and reproduction command.
  Platform-impossible results include probe data, backend, environment, and
  reviewer-facing reason. Failed results are blocking diagnostics.

`EditorLabEvidenceArtifactKind`
: Must distinguish retained UI debug from native screenshots, GPU visual diffs,
  focus traversal reports, contrast sample reports, timing reports,
  diagnostics snapshots, activation reports, rollback reports, and unsupported
  or platform-impossible reports.

`EditorLabEvidenceManifest`
: Must validate that every no-gap required capability has a captured or
  platform-impossible result. Free-form unsupported checks are not sufficient
  for PM002 closeout.

## Runtime Evidence Matrix

| Target | Captured evidence | Platform-impossible evidence | Blocking failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native screenshot | Window/runtime screenshot artifact with command, backend, scenario id, dimensions, and artifact path. | Probe names the missing native window/capture API or headless backend limitation. | Retained artifact only, with no probe result. |
| GPU visual diff | Before/after image or retained-to-native comparison artifact with threshold and changed/unchanged region summary. | Probe names unavailable GPU readback or diff backend and records why no equivalent can run. | Static descriptor or status text passed as visual diff. |
| Native focus traversal | Ordered focus traversal report from native or retained focus owner, including routes and disabled reasons. | Probe records that native focus cannot be driven in the current backend and retained route inspection is the accepted fallback. | No focus/focusable-route artifact. |
| Pixel contrast sampling | Pixel or retained-token contrast report with sampled subject, foreground/background source, ratio, and limits. | Probe records absence of pixel access and links retained token evidence. | Human note without sample data. |
| Timing | Screenshot/diff/setup/formation timing report with scenario id and environment. | Probe records unavailable timing source and retained timing substitute. | Timing claim with no artifact. |
| Diagnostics/degraded/reload/apply/rollback/failure preservation | Scenario-linked RON or text artifacts from the app-hosted path. | Not applicable unless the runtime cannot execute the scenario; that becomes a blocking design issue. | Console-only or descriptor-only evidence. |

## Implementation Shape

Use a Strangler migration over PM006:

1. Add typed capability, probe, result, and artifact-kind contracts beside the
   existing PM006 manifest.
2. Keep PM006 artifact compatibility while adding a no-gap manifest version or
   extension that records per-capability results.
3. Convert unsupported checks into typed `PlatformImpossible` results only when
   a probe justifies the classification.
4. Add focused manifest validation rejecting missing no-gap capability results.
5. Extend the artifact-writing PM006 test or add a PM002 test that writes the
   PM002 evidence bundle under the PM002 closeout directory.
6. Preserve app ownership of artifact writing and runtime probing.

## Validation

The linked implementation row must include focused validation:

```text
cargo fmt
cargo test -p runenwerk_editor editor_lab_evidence
cargo test -p runenwerk_editor pm_ui_lab_perf_002
$env:RUNENWERK_WRITE_PM_UI_LAB_PERF_002_EVIDENCE='1'; cargo test -p runenwerk_editor pm_ui_lab_perf_002_runtime_evidence_platform_closure -- --nocapture
task docs:validate
task puml:validate
task roadmap:render
task roadmap:validate
task roadmap:check
task production:render
task production:validate
task production:check
task planning:validate
git diff --check
```

Tests must prove:

- descriptor-only evidence is rejected;
- each no-gap capability has a captured, platform-impossible, or failed
  result;
- platform-impossible results require probe metadata;
- native/retained artifacts are scenario-linked and reproducible;
- app-owned evidence code does not move into `ui_definition` or
  `editor_definition`.

## WR Candidate

The bounded implementation row is `WR-105: UI Lab runtime evidence platform
closure`.

Primary write scopes:

- `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/editor_lab_evidence/mod.rs`
- `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/tests.rs`
- `docs-site/src/content/docs/reports/implementation-plans/wr-105-ui-lab-runtime-evidence-platform-closure/plan.md`
- `docs-site/src/content/docs/reports/closeouts/pm-ui-lab-perf-002-runtime-evidence-platform-closure/closeout.md`
- `docs-site/src/content/docs/workspace/production-tracks.yaml`
- `docs-site/src/content/docs/workspace/roadmap-items.yaml`

Runtime artifacts belong under the PM002 closeout directory. Raw artifacts must
not be mixed into prose docs.

## Non-Goals

PM002 does not:

- implement command catalog or surface registry source-of-truth closure;
- redesign direct-manipulation UX;
- change persistence/diff/apply APIs or public examples;
- complete final no-gap certification;
- move screenshot, focus, contrast, timing, provider sessions, or artifact
  writing into `domain/ui/ui_definition`;
- treat a free-form unsupported string as no-gap evidence.

## Stop Conditions

Stop before implementation if:

- ownership of native capture, focus, contrast, timing, or visual diff cannot
  stay app-owned;
- platform-impossible evidence would be asserted without probe metadata;
- evidence would be descriptor-only, status-panel-only, console-only, or
  retained-only where a native capability is available;
- a reusable cross-domain evidence platform is required without an accepted ADR
  or design update;
- PM002 scope begins command/surface closure, direct manipulation UX closure,
  API ergonomics closure, or final certification work.

# UI Designer Persistence Migration Diff And Activation Design

## Status

This is the accepted implementation design for `PM-UI-DESIGN-009`.

It defines the ownership and contract shape for deterministic authored UI
definition persistence, migration dry-runs, reviewable textual diffs, and
fail-closed activation gates. It does not implement code, select a WR roadmap
row, or authorize product code until a linked WR row exists and passes
`task production:plan`.

## Goal

UI/interface definitions must move from persisted authored documents to active
projection input through a reproducible, inspectable gate:

```text
authored UI definition document
  -> schema/version gate
  -> migration dry-run
  -> deterministic normalized document
  -> reviewable textual diff
  -> validation bundle
  -> activation decision
```

The gate protects source truth. It does not execute editor commands, mutate
gameplay state, own provider sessions, create renderer resources, or bypass
target-profile validation.

## Architecture Governance Result

Architecture governance accepts this implementation direction:

- `domain/ui/ui_definition` owns runtime-neutral persistence contracts for
  authored UI definition schema versions, migration requests, dry-run reports,
  unknown-field preservation policy, deterministic textual diff descriptors,
  activation requests, activation decisions, and blocking diagnostics.
- `domain/editor/editor_definition` owns editor/workbench-specific persisted
  extension vocabulary, workbench profile references, menu/shortcut extension
  metadata, editor command descriptors, and adapter-owned translation into the
  generic persistence gate.
- Future game UI target domains own game-runtime-specific persisted extension
  vocabulary and adapter-owned translation into the generic persistence gate.
- `apps/runenwerk_editor` may own concrete project file IO, save/load
  orchestration, user-facing diff review, and activation UI, but it must call
  domain contracts instead of owning canonical UI/interface persistence truth.
- Runtime, provider, renderer, and app layers consume activated projections or
  activation reports; they do not decide whether authored definitions are
  schema-compatible, migratable, or diffable.

No new ADR is required for the first PM-009 design because ADR-0004 separates
description from execution, ADR-0005 treats projections as derived state,
ADR-0001 keeps commands domain-owned, and ADR-0012 keeps host capability policy
explicit. A future ADR or accepted design update is required before generic UI
persistence owns project storage, provider sessions, runtime state, renderer
handles, gameplay truth, or concrete editor command execution.

## Persistence Contract

Every persisted authored UI definition package includes:

- stable document id;
- schema version;
- definition category or target family;
- source package provenance;
- deterministic node, recipe, token, binding, fixture, and target-profile
  references;
- extension ownership metadata for editor/workbench or game-runtime vocabulary;
- compatible unknown-field buckets where preservation is allowed;
- source-map-capable paths for diagnostics and diffs.

Persistence serialization must be deterministic. Field order, id formatting,
child ordering, extension ordering, and unknown-field ordering must be stable
enough that identical authored definitions produce identical textual output.

## Migration Dry-Run Contract

Migration requests include:

- source document id;
- source schema version;
- target schema version;
- source package provenance;
- target profile when migration depends on profile compatibility;
- requested migration mode: inspect, dry-run, or activation preflight;
- unknown-field preservation policy;
- source location metadata when available.

Migration is always a dry-run before activation. It reports:

- original and target schema versions;
- changed fields;
- incompatible fields;
- dropped fields and the reason they cannot be preserved;
- preserved compatible unknown fields;
- source-mapped diagnostics;
- deterministic migrated document preview;
- reviewable textual diff descriptor.

The migration step must not mutate the active definition set by itself.
Unsupported schema versions, incompatible migrations, malformed stable ids,
unknown required fields, and target-profile-incompatible extensions fail before
activation.

## Diff Contract

Textual diff descriptors include:

- stable diff id;
- source document id;
- before and after schema versions;
- changed paths;
- before and after values when they are safe to display;
- source locations;
- ordering policy used for serialization;
- affected target profiles;
- activation impact;
- deterministic diff text or a diagnostic explaining why a diff cannot be
  produced.

Any edit, migration, or formatting path that cannot produce a deterministic
reviewable textual diff remains preview-only and cannot activate.

## Activation Gate Contract

Activation requests include:

- document id;
- target profile;
- validation mode: dry-run, activate, or rollback preflight;
- migration report reference;
- diff descriptor reference;
- expected diagnostics;
- required capability evidence;
- preview fixture evidence references when available;
- source package provenance.

Activation decisions are fail-closed. A definition can activate only when:

- schema and version gates pass;
- required migrations are supported;
- incompatible fields are absent or explicitly blocked;
- compatible unknown fields are preserved where policy allows;
- deterministic textual diff output exists;
- Canonical UI IR validation passes;
- target-profile compatibility passes;
- binding, recipe, token, fixture, capability, and preview-only guards pass;
- expected diagnostics match actual diagnostics;
- no blocking diagnostics remain.

Activation may produce a report consumed by apps, runtimes, and preview
orchestration, but the report is an observation artifact. It must not execute
commands, write project files, mutate gameplay state, or create runtime
resources.

## Diagnostics

Persistence, migration, diff, and activation diagnostics include:

- stable diagnostic code;
- severity;
- source location when available;
- document id;
- source and target schema versions when relevant;
- affected target profile;
- changed path or incompatible path;
- owning domain;
- source package;
- expected and actual diagnostic references;
- activation impact;
- suggested fix.

The first taxonomy covers unsupported schema versions, unknown required fields,
malformed stable ids, incompatible migrations, unpreservable unknown fields,
non-deterministic serialization, non-deterministic diff output, missing
migration reports, missing diff descriptors, target-profile incompatibility,
expected diagnostic mismatches, and preview-only activation attempts.

## Implementation Row

No PM-009 implementation WR row is selected by this design action.

The next legal production-track action after this design is accepted is to add
or select one bounded WR row. That row should cover only the first generic
`domain/ui/ui_definition` persistence, migration dry-run, deterministic diff,
activation request, activation decision, and diagnostic contract slice.

The first row must not implement app-hosted project save/load UI, user-facing
diff review UI, runtime activation plumbing, provider session orchestration,
gameplay mutation, renderer resources, screenshot capture, or production
readiness.

## Required Fitness Functions

The first implementation row must add focused validation for:

- current-version documents passing migration without diagnostics;
- unsupported schema versions blocking activation;
- incompatible migration diagnostics;
- compatible unknown field preservation where policy allows;
- unpreservable unknown field diagnostics;
- deterministic textual serialization or diff descriptor output;
- preview-only or non-diffable edits rejecting activation;
- activation requiring a successful migration report and diff descriptor;
- target-profile compatibility diagnostics before activation;
- expected diagnostic mismatch diagnostics;
- editor/workbench and game-runtime examples without sharing project IO,
  provider, runtime, renderer, or gameplay ownership.

## Non-Goals

PM-009 design acceptance does not:

- implement app-hosted persistence UI, save/load UI, or diff review UI;
- implement concrete project file IO in `apps/runenwerk_editor`;
- implement runtime activation plumbing;
- implement provider session orchestration;
- implement screenshot capture, visual regression, or renderer golden evidence;
- implement accessibility/performance reporting from `PM-UI-DESIGN-010`;
- move editor, gameplay, render, material, scene, asset, simulation, save-game,
  network, project, provider, app, runtime, or screenshot truth into generic UI
  persistence contracts.

## Acceptance Bar

PM-009 can move from `designing` to ready-next planning when:

- this accepted design exists;
- the production milestone points to this accepted design gate;
- production, roadmap, docs, and planning validators pass;
- a bounded WR row can be added or selected for the first generic persistence,
  migration dry-run, deterministic diff, and activation gate contract slice.

# UI Lab App-Hosted Editor Lab Surface Shell Design

## Status

This is the accepted implementation design for `PM-UI-LAB-003`.

It clears the design gate for the app-hosted Editor Lab surface shell only. It
does not authorize product code until a linked WR row is selected, production
planning produces a decision-complete implementation contract, and roadmap
promotion gates pass.

## Goal

The Editor Design workspace must become a usable Editor Lab workbench, not a
debug-style self-authoring control panel. Authors need direct controls for
definition selection, hierarchy inspection, palette-driven creation, retained
preview or canvas viewing, focused inspection, command or apply review,
diagnostics, and preview-console feedback.

The product shell path is:

```text
registered Editor Design surfaces
  -> app-owned Editor Lab state/view-model translation
  -> typed editor-shell surface view models and composition builders
  -> direct controls and provider-local routes
  -> app-owned shell command dispatch
  -> runtime evidence from the launched editor
```

The milestone proves the shell experience and control routing. Operation
history, project IO, complete diff/apply/rollback, preview evidence matrices,
public API examples, and the final no-gap audit remain later milestones.

## Current Code Truth

The current Editor Design profile already mounts a useful surface set through
`apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/tool_suites/editor_design_tool_suite.rs`:
definition outliner, UI hierarchy, UI canvas, style inspector, bindings, dock
layout preview, theme editor, shortcut editor, menu editor, definition
validation, and command diff.

The current provider implementation in
`apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/providers/self_authoring.rs` is still mostly a
line/action adapter:

- `UiCanvas` can return a formed retained preview for a selected UI template.
- Other Editor Design surfaces call
  `domain/editor/editor_shell/src/composition/build_self_authoring_control_panel.rs`.
- Selection, duplicate, rename, delete, export, apply, rollback, node text
  editing, theme color editing, and workspace layout edits are exposed as
  generic compact action buttons with hard-coded values.
- Diagnostics and command diff are text summaries, not structured review
  surfaces.
- There is no normal palette surface, no structured inspector fields, no
  direct text or enum controls for authored values, no preview-console surface,
  and no degraded-provider shell experience beyond fallback lines.

The app-owned state in `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/self_authoring.rs`
already provides useful behavior: checked-in fixture loading, document
selection, node selection, duplicate/rename/delete/import/export, selected
diagnostics, retained preview formation, basic apply preview, apply snapshots,
and rollback snapshots.

`apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/dispatch_shell_command.rs` already keeps
execution app-owned. Provider-local editor-definition actions map to
`ShellCommand` values and then mutate `SelfAuthoringWorkspaceState` or append
console diagnostics. PM-003 must preserve that command boundary.

`PM-UI-LAB-002` made command projection and surface metadata registry-backed.
PM-003 must consume those boundaries instead of reintroducing route, label,
surface, or provider-family side tables.

## Architecture Governance Result

Architecture governance was run for this scope:

```text
task ai:architecture-governance -- --task "PM-UI-LAB-003 App-Hosted Editor Lab Surface Shell design gate" --scope "docs-site/src/content/docs/design/active/ui-lab-productization-design.md; docs-site/src/content/docs/workspace/production-tracks.yaml; apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/providers/self_authoring.rs; apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/self_authoring.rs; apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/tool_suites/editor_design_tool_suite.rs; domain/editor/editor_shell/src/composition/build_self_authoring_control_panel.rs; domain/editor/editor_shell/src/composition/build_editor_shell.rs; domain/editor/editor_shell/src/surfaces/editor_definition.rs; domain/editor/editor_definition; domain/ui/ui_definition"
```

Governance decisions:

- DDD owner: the stream-aligned editor app owns the Editor Lab product shell.
- Supporting owners: `domain/editor/editor_shell` owns structural surface
  contracts and app-neutral composition helpers; `domain/editor/editor_definition`
  owns reusable editor definition validation and document mechanics;
  `domain/ui/ui_definition` owns behavior-free UI definition formation and
  generic visual layout contracts.
- Clean Architecture direction: `domain/ui/ui_definition` must not import app,
  shell-provider, project IO, renderer, runtime, or editor execution behavior.
  `apps/runenwerk_editor` may compose domain contracts and own concrete Editor
  Lab state, commands, provider behavior, console output, runtime activation,
  and evidence capture.
- Source truth invariant: authored definitions and app-owned Editor Lab draft
  state are source truth. Formed retained previews, shell surface frames,
  provider output, and screenshot artifacts are derived evidence.
- Translation boundary: provider interactions cross from direct controls into
  typed `SurfaceLocalAction::EditorDefinition` actions, then into app-owned
  `ShellCommand` dispatch. Domain crates expose contracts and composition, not
  app execution.
- ADR need: no new ADR is required for PM-003 if the work only replaces the
  generic line/action shell with typed Editor Lab view models and direct
  controls while preserving accepted command, projection, provider, and
  description-versus-execution decisions. A new ADR or accepted design update is
  required before moving Editor Lab project IO, command execution, runtime
  activation, or provider behavior into generic domain crates.
- Ownership mode: stream-aligned editor product work with complicated-subsystem
  support from editor-shell and UI-definition owners.

## Product Surface Contract

PM-003 introduces an app-hosted Editor Lab shell contract with these normal
surfaces:

| Surface | Responsibility | Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Definition hierarchy | Browse loaded authored definition documents, show kind/lifecycle/diagnostic state, select without generic action lists. | App state read model, editor-shell composition. |
| Palette | Present valid document, surface, widget, and layout creation affordances for the selected target profile. | App provider consumes registry and editor-definition contracts. |
| Canvas or preview | Show the retained UI preview for UI template documents, selected-node context, and degraded states for non-previewable documents. | `ui_definition` forms retained UI; app provider owns selection/degraded interpretation. |
| Inspector | Expose focused fields for selected document, UI node, theme token, workspace layout, menu, shortcut, or binding document. | Editor-definition contracts plus app command translation. |
| Command diff and apply review | Show selected document diagnostics and current apply-preview summary as a structured review surface. | App state now; PM-005 owns complete diff/apply/rollback productization. |
| Diagnostics | Show typed validation and provider diagnostics with severity, code, message, and source path. | Owning domain diagnostics, app provider presentation. |
| Preview console | Show recent Editor Lab command, provider, and preview events without requiring the global debug action list. | App runtime console or app-owned Editor Lab console adapter. |

Normal PM-003 workflows must be direct product controls. A surface may use a
degraded fallback panel only for unsupported state, provider failure, or an
explicit compatibility route. The generic text/action panel must not be the
normal path for supported Editor Lab surfaces.

## Typed View-Model Boundary

Add or extend editor-shell contracts in
`domain/editor/editor_shell/src/surfaces/editor_definition.rs` for app-neutral
Editor Lab surface view models and actions. The contracts should describe
surface shape, stable row or field ids, labels, selected ids, disabled reasons,
diagnostics, and routeable editor-definition actions.

Expected view-model families:

- `EditorLabDefinitionHierarchyViewModel`
- `EditorLabPaletteViewModel`
- `EditorLabCanvasPreviewViewModel`
- `EditorLabInspectorViewModel`
- `EditorLabReviewViewModel`
- `EditorLabDiagnosticsViewModel`
- `EditorLabConsoleViewModel`

These view models are not source truth and must not execute behavior. The app
provider builds them from `SelfAuthoringWorkspaceState`, command catalog data,
tool-surface registry data, and editor-definition validation reports.

Composition helpers belong under
`domain/editor/editor_shell/src/composition` using responsibility-oriented
module names, for example an `editor_lab` submodule with hierarchy, palette,
canvas, inspector, review, diagnostics, and console builders. Do not extend
`build_self_authoring_control_panel.rs` into a broader catch-all.

## App Provider Boundary

`apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/providers/self_authoring.rs` remains the first
implementation owner for Editor Lab provider behavior in PM-003. It may be
renamed only if the implementation can preserve migration clarity and test
history; a broad rename is not required for PM-003.

The provider must:

- request surface metadata from the registry-backed surface contract created in
  PM-002;
- build typed Editor Lab view models from app-owned self-authoring state;
- compose direct controls from editor-shell builders;
- route controls through `SurfaceLocalAction::EditorDefinition`;
- map provider-local actions to app-owned `ShellCommand` values;
- report unavailable or unsupported states with typed diagnostics or explicit
  degraded-provider view models;
- keep hard-coded demo values out of normal user workflows.

`apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/self_authoring.rs` may expose additional read
models and narrow command helpers needed by the shell, but it must not become a
generic domain crate during PM-003. PM-004 and PM-005 own operation history and
project IO boundaries.

## Ergonomics Requirements

PM-003 must remove these current friction points from normal workflows:

- document selection as a long list of generic buttons;
- hard-coded edits such as `Edited in self-authoring` and `#5f8cff`;
- action-only theme, menu, shortcut, and binding editing;
- diagnostic text lines without severity/code/path structure;
- command diff text without a reviewable surface shape;
- non-previewable documents that look like missing implementation instead of
  explicit degraded states;
- hidden command feedback that requires reading only global console lines.

Direct controls should use the existing retained UI widget vocabulary: lists,
trees, buttons, text inputs where interaction routing already supports text,
toggles, menus, and compact panels. PM-003 does not need to invent a new UI
framework.

## Migration Strategy

Use a Strangler Fig replacement for the line/action path:

1. Add typed Editor Lab view models and composition builders beside
   `build_self_authoring_control_panel.rs`.
2. Route one Editor Design surface at a time from line/action output to a typed
   direct-control builder.
3. Preserve provider-local action mapping and shell command dispatch while
   changing only presentation and surface ergonomics.
4. Keep a named degraded fallback for unsupported or failed provider states.
5. Add tests that fail if supported Editor Design surfaces regress to generic
   line/action panels.
6. Remove or narrow `build_self_authoring_control_panel.rs` only after no normal
   Editor Lab workflow depends on it.

## Runtime Evidence Requirements

PM-003 closeout may claim `runtime_proven` only when evidence proves the app
shell path, not only descriptors:

- the launched editor or an equivalent app-hosted shell harness opens the
  Editor Design profile;
- mounted Editor Design surfaces resolve through registry metadata and provider
  frames;
- direct controls select an authored definition document and UI node;
- a supported edit runs through the app-owned command boundary and updates the
  retained preview or structured inspector state;
- diagnostics and command/apply review surfaces show structured data;
- a degraded-provider or non-previewable-document state is visible and typed;
- a preview console or app-owned console adapter records user-visible feedback;
- evidence artifacts are stored near the PM-003 closeout.

Screenshots or equivalent visual artifacts are required for the visible shell
states PM-003 claims. PM-006 still owns the broader scenario matrix,
accessibility checks, performance evidence, and visual-diff suite.

## Fitness Functions

The PM-003 implementation WR must include focused validation before closeout:

- editor-shell tests for each Editor Lab composition builder and route table;
- app-shell tests proving every supported Editor Design surface builds a typed
  product surface instead of the generic self-authoring action panel;
- provider tests for degraded non-previewable and provider-failure states;
- dispatch tests for direct controls that select documents, select UI nodes,
  edit a supported text or theme field, and surface diagnostics;
- runtime evidence test or harness that writes a PM-003 proof artifact;
- source or behavior guard preventing hard-coded demo edit values from becoming
  normal workflows;
- docs, roadmap, production, and planning validation.

Minimum validation commands for the linked WR row:

```text
cargo fmt
cargo test -p editor_shell editor_lab
cargo test -p runenwerk_editor editor_lab
cargo test -p runenwerk_editor pm_ui_lab_003
task docs:validate
task puml:validate
task roadmap:render
task roadmap:validate
task roadmap:check
task production:render
task production:validate
task production:check
task planning:validate
```

## WR Candidate

The next roadmap row should be a bounded implementation slice, tentatively
`WR-084: UI Lab app-hosted Editor Lab surface shell`.

Primary write scopes:

- `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/providers/self_authoring.rs`
- `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/self_authoring.rs`
- `apps/runenwerk_editor/src/shell/tool_suites/editor_design_tool_suite.rs`
- `domain/editor/editor_shell/src/surfaces/editor_definition.rs`
- `domain/editor/editor_shell/src/composition`
- `domain/editor/editor_shell/src/workspace/profile.rs`
- `docs-site/src/content/docs/reports/implementation-plans/wr-084-ui-lab-app-hosted-editor-lab-surface-shell/plan.md`
- `docs-site/src/content/docs/reports/closeouts/pm-ui-lab-003-app-hosted-editor-lab-surface-shell/closeout.md`
- `docs-site/src/content/docs/workspace/production-tracks.yaml`
- `docs-site/src/content/docs/workspace/roadmap-items.yaml`

Expected dependencies:

- `WR-004` for ongoing UI/editor guard coverage.
- `WR-046` for UI Designer doctrine and target-boundary ratification.
- `WR-083` for completed command catalog and registry-owned surface metadata.

The row should start as ready-next unless roadmap promotion policy selects it
as current candidate. Product code still requires `task production:plan
-- --milestone PM-UI-LAB-003 --roadmap WR-084` and the implementation contract
it produces.

## Non-Goals

PM-003 does not implement:

- operation history, undo/redo, deterministic operation diffs, or full visual
  authoring operation routing owned by PM-004;
- app project packages, save/load/import/export/reload, complete diff/apply,
  activation failure preservation, or rollback productization owned by PM-005;
- preview scenario matrix, visual diffing, accessibility checks, performance
  evidence, or broad degraded-provider evidence owned by PM-006;
- focused public API guides, examples, public API ergonomics review, or final
  runtime-proven track closeout owned by PM-007;
- game-runtime UI projection execution;
- moving editor execution behavior into `domain/ui/ui_definition`.

## Stop Conditions

Stop before implementation if PM-003 would:

- require `ui_definition` to own editor behavior, provider behavior, project IO,
  command execution, runtime activation, or app console state;
- require `editor_shell` composition output or provider frames to become source
  truth;
- bypass the command catalog or surface registry completed in PM-002;
- claim runtime proof without app-hosted shell evidence and visible artifacts;
- implement PM-004, PM-005, PM-006, or PM-007 scope under the shell milestone;
- need durable ownership or dependency changes without a new accepted ADR or
  design update.

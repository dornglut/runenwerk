# ECS Crate

`ecs` is the ECS runtime foundation in the `domain` layer.

## Quick Overview

- `World`: entities/components/resources, event channels, component indexes, spatial indexes
- Query runtime: `Query`, `QueryState`, `QueryOrphaned`
- Runtime and scheduling bridge: `Runtime`, `IntoSystem`, set ordering (`in_set`, `before`, `after`)
- System params: `Res`, `ResMut`, `ResView`, `Commands`, `BroadcastReader`, `BroadcastWriter`
- Deferred mutation primitives: `Commands`, `DeferredCommand`, `BatchCommands`
- Stateful tracking: `StatefulComponent`, `component_state`, `mark_stateful_changed`

## Minimal Getting Started

```rust
use ecs::prelude::*;

#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, PartialEq, ecs::Component)]
struct Position {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
}

let mut world = World::new();
let entity = world.spawn(Position { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 });
world.require_mut::<Position>(entity).unwrap().x += 1.0;
assert_eq!(world.require::<Position>(entity).unwrap().x, 2.0);
```

## SDF-First Execution Ownership

For the SDF-first open-world substrate, ECS owns live runtime state, system
interfaces, deferred command visibility, and the runtime query contracts that
feed query snapshot products. The scheduler owns deterministic planning and
barriers; engine runtime owns execution; product-family domains own product
truth.

Near-term ECS work should preserve serial equivalence while adding explicit
product-publication and query-snapshot behavior at scheduler barriers. ECS must
not become a global product registry or renderer truth source.

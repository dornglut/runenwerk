# Scheduler Crate (Retired)

The standalone `domain/scheduler` crate was retired by RunenECS C8.

Its reusable ECS-owned semantics now live in standalone `runen-ecs`: generic
schedule labels, system sets, explicit semantic ordering, ECS access facts,
validation, deterministic serial reference execution, and deferred-command /
deferred-publication frontiers.

Application lifecycle and publication policy remain owned by Runenwerk Engine. The retired scheduler's phases, waves, product/query publication barriers, generic DAG/demo/DOT/filesystem utilities, and scheduler-global telemetry are not current authority and are not compatibility contracts.

Use current authority instead:

- [RunenECS overview](../ecs/00-overview.md)
- [RunenECS architecture](../ecs/architecture.md)
- [Accepted RunenECS extraction boundary](../../design/accepted/runenecs-extraction-boundary-design.md)
- [Accepted RunenECS boundary repair plan](../../design/accepted/runenecs-boundary-repair-execution-plan.md)

Historical implementation details remain available through repository history and historical reports; they must not be used to reconstruct a standalone scheduler owner.

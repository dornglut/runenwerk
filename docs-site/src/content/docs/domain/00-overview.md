# Domain Layer Overview

## Purpose

The domain layer contains engine-agnostic reusable contracts, models, invariants, and domain logic.

Domain crates define what concepts mean and what rules they must obey. They do not own app wiring, backend integration, renderer execution, editor application policy, or runtime orchestration.

## Dependency Rule

Domain crates may depend on foundation crates and carefully selected lower-level domain contract crates.

Domain crates must not depend on:

- runtime/app code;
- backend adapters;
- editor application wiring;
- AI integrations;
- concrete rendering, windowing, input, or audio backends unless the domain explicitly owns that backend.

## Current Domain Areas

| Area | Crates | Primary docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ECS integration | standalone [`runen-ecs`](https://github.com/dornglut/runen-ecs), consumed by Runenwerk through an exact accepted revision | Retained Runenwerk-facing API and integration guidance: [`ecs/00-overview.md`](./ecs/00-overview.md), [`ecs/README.md`](./ecs/README.md), [`ecs/usage-guide.md`](./ecs/usage-guide.md) |
| Scene | `domain/scene` | [`scene/README.md`](./scene/README.md) |
| Asset and product contracts | `domain/asset`, `domain/product` | Workspace-level current-state contract summaries live in [`../workspace/sdf-first-execution-roadmap.md`](../workspace/sdf-first-execution-roadmap.md), [`../design/accepted/field-product-contracts-diagnostics-and-residency-design.md`](../design/accepted/field-product-contracts-diagnostics-and-residency-design.md), and [`../design/accepted/sdf-first-production-capability-map.md`](../design/accepted/sdf-first-production-capability-map.md) until deeper crate guides are written. |
| Geometry | `domain/geometry` | [`geometry/README.md`](./geometry/README.md), [`geometry/ownership-boundary.md`](./geometry/ownership-boundary.md), [`geometry/api-notes.md`](./geometry/api-notes.md) |
| Materials and textures | `domain/material_graph`, `domain/texture` | [`material-graph/README.md`](./material-graph/README.md), [`texture/README.md`](./texture/README.md) |
| Procedural generation | `domain/procgen` | [`procgen/README.md`](./procgen/README.md) for generator documents, planning lifecycle, reservations, deterministic lowering, and product-output boundaries |
| Drawing | `domain/drawing` | [`drawing/README.md`](./drawing/README.md) |
| Spatial / world data | `domain/world_ops`, `domain/world_sdf` | Standalone [RunenSpatial](https://github.com/dornglut/runen-spatial) owns reusable spatial mechanics; Runenwerk retains [`world-ops/README.md`](./world-ops/README.md) and [`world-sdf/README.md`](./world-sdf/README.md) integration/domain policy. |
| UI substrate and definitions | `domain/ui/*`, including `domain/ui/ui_definition` | [`ui/README.md`](./ui/README.md), [`ui/architecture.md`](./ui/architecture.md), [`ui/roadmap.md`](./ui/roadmap.md) |
| Editor domains and definitions | `domain/editor/*`, including `domain/editor/editor_definition` | [`editor/README.md`](./editor/README.md) |

Generic ECS schedule identity, system sets, semantic ordering, access facts,
validation, deterministic serial reference execution, and deferred-command
visibility are owned by standalone RunenECS. Runenwerk consumes those public
contracts; it does not retain a local ECS implementation or an active
standalone `domain/scheduler` crate.

## Planned Domain Areas

These areas are roadmap-level intent, not implemented workspace members.
Do not add crate metadata for them until their implementation milestone lands.

- particles and VFX;
- physics and collision authoring;
- animation and procedural motion, with a deferred architecture target tracked in [`../design/deferred/sdf-procedural-animation-and-animated-models-design.md`](../design/deferred/sdf-procedural-animation-and-animated-models-design.md);
- simulation/world processes;
- gameplay graph orchestration after narrower gameplay event/action/state/quest contracts exist.

## What Belongs in Domain

Domain documentation should define:

- ownership boundaries;
- domain concepts;
- invariants;
- allowed dependencies;
- command or mutation contracts;
- ratification and validation rules;
- data model semantics;
- engine-agnostic usage examples;
- integration contracts consumed by engine/runtime or apps.

## What Does Not Belong in Domain

Domain documentation should not own:

- renderer backend details;
- windowing details;
- app startup wiring;
- editor UI implementation policy;
- transport backend configuration;
- LLM, prompt, or agent behavior;
- production runtime orchestration unless the domain explicitly owns the abstraction.

## Documentation Map

Start here when working in the domain layer:

- ECS: [`ecs/00-overview.md`](./ecs/00-overview.md)
- ECS usage: [`ecs/usage-guide.md`](./ecs/usage-guide.md)
- ECS advanced guide: [`ecs/advanced-guide.md`](./ecs/advanced-guide.md)
- Geometry: [`geometry/README.md`](./geometry/README.md)
- Asset/product contracts: [`../design/accepted/field-product-contracts-diagnostics-and-residency-design.md`](../design/accepted/field-product-contracts-diagnostics-and-residency-design.md)
- Spatial mechanics: standalone [RunenSpatial](https://github.com/dornglut/runen-spatial); Runenwerk retains world-operation, SDF, and runtime integration policy.
- Signed-field mathematics: standalone [RunenSDF](https://github.com/dornglut/runen-sdf); Runenwerk retains only product/world integration such as [`world-sdf/README.md`](./world-sdf/README.md).
- Material graph: [`material-graph/README.md`](./material-graph/README.md)
- Texture: [`texture/README.md`](./texture/README.md)
- Procgen contract: [`procgen/README.md`](./procgen/README.md)
- Drawing: [`drawing/README.md`](./drawing/README.md)
- UI substrate: [`ui/README.md`](./ui/README.md)

For workspace-wide placement, membership, and dependency ownership, see:

- [`../guidelines/architecture.md`](../guidelines/architecture.md) for Runenwerk placement and boundary guidance;
- [`../workspace/crate-inventory.md`](../workspace/crate-inventory.md) for current local workspace members;
- [`../guidelines/dependency-rules.md`](../guidelines/dependency-rules.md) for dependency direction and peer-framework ownership;
- [`../workspace/crate-docs-status.md`](../workspace/crate-docs-status.md) for documentation coverage.

## Known Gaps

The following domain areas still need deeper crate-level usage and architecture docs beyond the current landing pages:

- `domain/scene`
- `domain/asset`
- `domain/product`
- `domain/world_ops`
- `domain/world_sdf`
- `domain/editor/editor_core`
- `domain/editor/editor_shell`
- `domain/editor/editor_viewport`
- `domain/editor/editor_scene`
- `domain/editor/editor_inspector`
- `domain/editor/editor_persistence`

These gaps should be filled with crate-level `README.md`, architecture, usage, and ownership-boundary docs only when the implementation is stable enough to document truthfully.

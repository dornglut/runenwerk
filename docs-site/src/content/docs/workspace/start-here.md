# Start Here

## Repository work

1. Read [`AGENTS.md`](../../../../../AGENTS.md) for the Runenwerk-specific executor contract over central Engineering authority.
2. Inspect the owning code and tests.
3. Read the [Runenwerk Platform Architecture](../architecture/runenwerk-platform-architecture.md)
   and the relevant accepted ADR or owner design for architectural work.
4. Use the active GitHub issue when the task is already planned.
5. Run focused checks while editing and `cargo validate` before merge; see [`TESTING.md`](../../../../../TESTING.md).

## Primary authority

- [`AGENTS.md`](../../../../../AGENTS.md) — Runenwerk-specific executor and repository-boundary rules.
- [`dornglut/engineering`](https://github.com/dornglut/engineering) — organization-wide work selection, GitHub mutation/review, validation-evidence semantics, repository standards, and cross-repository governance.
- [`TESTING.md`](../../../../../TESTING.md) — Runenwerk-local validation and CI semantics.
- [Documentation Structure](documentation-structure.md) — where durable Runenwerk documents belong.
- [Runenwerk Platform Architecture](../architecture/runenwerk-platform-architecture.md) — current top-down platform spine.
- [Roadmap](planning/roadmap.md) — high-level sequencing.
- [Framework Integration Architecture](../architecture/repository-family-architecture.md) — Runenwerk-owned adapter, compatibility, recovery, and product-integration contracts over independently owned frameworks.
- [Dependency Rules](../guidelines/dependency-rules.md) — Runenwerk-local dependency and integration rules.

## Architecture cold start

For a cross-domain architecture task, use this order:

```text
Runenwerk Platform Architecture
  -> owning accepted ADR(s)
  -> owning subsystem/framework architecture
  -> active issue and delivery design
  -> current code/tests
```

Accepted ADRs override conflicting active/historical design material.

## Review

A pull request is reviewed against its actual diff, owning tests, accepted authority, acceptance criteria, and exact-head CI. Historical reports and superseded workflow/design pages do not authorize new work.

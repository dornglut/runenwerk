# SDF-First Open-World Substrate Roadmap

## Purpose

This is the canonical cross-track sequencing roadmap for turning the accepted
SDF-first field-product architecture into an editable, streamable,
deterministic open-world substrate.

The target result is not finished open-world gameplay in one jump. The target
is the substrate that makes open-world gameplay possible without private
execution paths or renderer-owned world truth.

The immediate M6.2C procgen bake/rollback/persistence gate is complete after
the Phase 6C concrete CPU preview proof. Future procgen work must continue to
build on the completed execution substrate, the `domain/procgen` contracts, the
editor/runtime overlay proof, formed preview products, and Phase 6D bake
evidence so gameplay graph, particles, physics, animation, world processes,
renderer residency, and strict runtime consumers use formed products without
inventing private execution paths.

Owning domain and app roadmaps still own detailed implementation steps. This
page owns cross-track ordering when those roadmaps overlap.

## End State

The long-term open-world substrate is:

```text
authored edits
  + deterministic procgen
  + SDF field products
  + query/render/physics consumers
  -> editable, streamable, diagnosable open world
```

Required end-state properties:

- authored edits remain governed operations or authored layers;
- deterministic procgen produces scoped products, not hidden runtime truth;
- formed SDF and field products carry identity, lineage, freshness, authority,
  residency, query policy, and diagnostics;
- product jobs publish only through deterministic barriers;
- strict consumers reject stale, fallback, ghost, missing, visual-only, and
  diagnostic-only products;
- render selections and GPU residency are derived from product truth;
- renderer, UI, and debug surfaces remain product consumers, not world truth.

## Current Focus

The current SDF-first M6.2C gate is complete: Phase 6D adds procgen offline
bake outcome formation, last-good bake rollback, app-owned bake archive
persistence, and runtime preview reload classification on top of the Phase
6A-6C procgen and product substrate.

Current gaps:

- worker pools, renderer rebuilds, GPU upload, caves, stamps, scatter, and
  biome systems remain deferred to later owning phases;
- future procgen phases must keep using product publication/query barriers,
  strict consumer policy, render selection, and derived GPU residency instead
  of adding private execution paths.

## Phased Roadmap

Use this order for current implementation planning. Each phase must close its
acceptance gate before product-domain implementation advances.

### Phase 0 - Batch 1 Contract Alignment

Status: complete.

Acceptance gate:

- shared product vocabulary exists in `domain/product`;
- current SDF, material, texture, asset/import, editor, scheduler, ECS, engine,
  and renderer-prep surfaces align with the vocabulary;
- serial behavior remains equivalent to the pre-batch runtime;
- full gate validation passes.

Out of scope:

- product-job dispatch;
- runtime query snapshot production;
- GPU residency;
- procgen implementation.

### Phase 1 - Serial Product Jobs And Publication Barriers

Status: complete as of 2026-05-12.

Intent: route current product formation through job descriptors and publish
formed outputs only at deterministic barriers while preserving serial runtime
behavior.

Closeout evidence:

- [reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-1/closeout.md](../reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-1/closeout.md)

Acceptance gate:

- product jobs have outcome/publication metadata with diagnostics;
- the runtime stages product outcomes and publishes them only at
  `ProductPublication` barriers;
- publication order is deterministic and inspectable;
- failed-preserved products require diagnostics and respect failure policy;
- current editor field-product jobs still run serially and remain app-owned
  until promoted deliberately.

Out of scope:

- worker pools or parallel execution;
- global product registry authority;
- procgen products;
- GPU upload or residency.

### Phase 2 - Query Snapshots And Strict Consumer Policy

Status: complete as of 2026-05-13.

Intent: make deferred/runtime queries explicit products with generation,
freshness, invalidation, consumer class, and diagnostics.

Closeout evidence:

- [reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-2/closeout.md](../reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-2/closeout.md)

Acceptance gate:

- runtime query snapshots carry source generation, response generation, scope,
  freshness, consumer class, invalidation policy, and diagnostics;
- strict consumers reject stale, fallback, ghost, missing, visual-only, and
  diagnostic-only products outside ratifiers, not only in unit tests;
- query-snapshot invalidation is deterministic and visible to diagnostics;
- editor and renderer consumers can inspect why a snapshot was accepted,
  rejected, or preserved.

Out of scope:

- broad AI, physics, or procgen behavior using snapshots;
- parallel query execution;
- fallback promotion into authoritative truth.

### Phase 3 - Render Product Selection Producers

Status: complete as of 2026-05-13.

Intent: populate backend-neutral `RenderProductSelection` from formed products,
generations, views, and diagnostics.

Closeout evidence:

- [reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-3/closeout.md](../reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-3/closeout.md)

Acceptance gate:

- render prepare produces selections from product descriptors and generations;
- selected products, stale/fallback/ghost markers, required targets, residency
  requests, and diagnostics are inspectable;
- render submit consumes prepared selections and does not perform live ECS
  extraction to discover product truth;
- renderer fallback behavior cannot bypass strict product policy.

Out of scope:

- SDF terrain renderer rebuild;
- GPU SDF residency;
- material or texture upload;
- renderer-owned product authority.

### Phase 4 - Derived GPU Residency

Status: complete as of 2026-05-13.

Intent: add renderer-owned GPU cache and residency management derived from
product selections.

Closeout evidence:

- [reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-4/closeout.md](../reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-4/closeout.md)

Acceptance gate:

- GPU resources are tied to product identity and generation;
- residency requests can allocate, preserve, evict, or invalidate derived caches
  with diagnostics;
- stale, fallback, ghost, missing, and failed-preserved states remain visible;
- backend handles stay inside renderer/backend code and never enter domain,
  editor, UI, or product descriptors.

Out of scope:

- renderer-owned world truth;
- procgen algorithms;
- full product-family render feature coverage beyond proving the residency
  contract.

### Phase 5 - Procgen Readiness Gate

Status: complete as of 2026-05-13.

Intent: accept the procgen ownership and product-domain contract before any
procgen code starts.

Closeout evidence:

- [reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-5/closeout.md](../reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-5/closeout.md)

Acceptance gate:

- `docs-site/src/content/docs/domain/procgen/README.md` is accepted;
- generator descriptor format, seed/scope/version policy, cache lineage,
  authored edit layering, runtime/offline generation policy, and multiplayer
  authority policy are decided;
- procgen products are defined as product-job outputs with publication,
  query-snapshot, strict-consumer, render-selection, and diagnostics paths;
- procgen editor surfaces remain design/docs-only until the contract is
  accepted.

Out of scope:

- `domain/procgen` code;
- generator algorithms;
- procgen preview or bake execution.

### Phase 6 - First Procgen Product Track

Status: Phase 6A, Phase 6B, and Phase 6C complete as of 2026-05-13. Phase 6D
complete as of 2026-05-14 for procgen bake, rollback, persistence, and runtime
preview reload classification on top of `domain/procgen`.

Closeout evidence:

- [reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-6a/closeout.md](../reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-6a/closeout.md)
- [reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-6b/closeout.md](../reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-6b/closeout.md)
- [reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-6c/closeout.md](../reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-6c/closeout.md)
- [reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-6d/closeout.md](../reports/closeouts/sdf-first-execution-phase-6d/closeout.md)

Intent: implement the first visible open-world producer on top of the completed
execution substrate. This is a procgen-owned product track, not a generic
content-platform launch.

Acceptance gate:

- `domain/procgen` owns deterministic generator documents, seed/scope/version
  contracts, planning lifecycle metadata, ratification, and lowering;
- first-slice prototypes, candidates, reservations, instance plans,
  realizations, and explanations are scoped to bounded region terrain/material
  generation;
- bounded generator jobs form products through product jobs and publication
  barriers;
- same seed, scope, version, inputs, and upstream generations produce identical
  operation windows and diagnostics;
- bake-to-`world_ops` and bake-to-field-product flows preserve authored edits
  and produce changed-region diagnostics.
- offline bake outcomes preserve rollback evidence, publish through product
  barriers, persist app-owned bake archives, and keep procgen graph reload
  classification live and typed.

Out of scope:

- full biome editor;
- full caves;
- gameplay spawn systems;
- procedural quests;
- particles, physics, animation, and world-process domains.

Phase 6A completed the domain-first portion of this gate: `domain/procgen`
documents, first-slice node semantics, ratification, deterministic
operation-window lowering, planning metadata, product job descriptors, product
descriptor builders, and ready publication DTOs. Phase 6B completed the first
editor/runtime visible proof: concrete procgen graph and preview providers,
app-owned procgen runtime state, product publication and query snapshot staging
through deterministic barriers, render-selection/residency participation, and
viewport status overlays for bounded changed regions and reservations. Phase 6C
completed the first concrete deterministic terrain/material generator: bounded
procgen documents now form scalar-distance and material-channel CPU
field-preview products through `world_sdf` preview contracts, publish the formed
descriptors through product barriers, snapshot them through query barriers, and
expose preview product summaries in the editor. Phase 6D completed the
bake/rollback/persistence/reload slice: `domain/procgen` forms offline bake
outcomes and rollback evidence, `runenwerk_editor` publishes accepted bakes
through product barriers, restores the last accepted bake on rollback, persists
bake archives as app-owned RON, and classifies procgen graph reloads as live
`ProcgenPreview` products.

## Procgen Code Gate

Further M6.2 procgen code must continue from the accepted
`docs-site/src/content/docs/domain/procgen/README.md` contract, the Phase 6A
`domain/procgen` implementation, the Phase 6B editor/runtime overlay proof, and
the Phase 6C formed CPU field-preview product path plus the Phase 6D
bake/rollback/persistence proof.

Procgen code must not bypass product jobs, query snapshots, publication
barriers, strict consumer policy, render product selection, or derived GPU
residency.

Gameplay graph, particles, physics, animation, and world-process domains follow
only after their owning contracts can consume the same substrate.

## Roadmap Ownership

- `workspace/sdf-first-execution-roadmap.md` owns cross-track order.
- `apps/runenwerk-editor/roadmap.md` owns editor milestone detail.
- `domain/scheduler/*` owns scheduler contract detail.
- `domain/ecs/*` owns ECS state, query, command, and runtime-bridge detail.
- `net/ecs-runtime-prioritized-roadmap.md` remains a net/runtime convergence
  tracker and feeds this roadmap where ECS runtime work is relevant.
- `engine/plugins/render/docs/roadmap.md` owns render implementation detail, but
  SDF renderer and GPU residency work must follow accepted product selection
  and residency contracts.

## Validation Expectations

Roadmap updates should verify:

- docs validation passes;
- no priority list says M6.2 procgen code starts outside the accepted procgen
  contract or completed execution substrate;
- completed contracts are marked as implemented and unfinished gates remain
  explicit;
- renderer, UI, and debug products remain derived state;
- strict consumers cannot be satisfied by visual-only product paths;
- `domain/product` is not described as a global product registry or authority
  owner.

## Finished Baselines

- editor M4 asset and field-product foundations exist;
- M5 runtime preview and reload boundaries exist for the current product
  families;
- M6.0 shared workspace substrate, M6.1 material/texture contracts, and P1 SDF
  modeling core exist;
- accepted SDF-first field-product, execution-fabric, and renderer-residency
  designs define the target architecture;
- Batch 1 contract alignment is complete: `domain/product`, product-core
  adapters, serial scheduler waves/barriers, ECS explicit deferred barriers,
  and backend-neutral render product-selection metadata exist;
- Phase 1 serial product jobs and publication barriers are complete:
  publication outcomes are ratified in `domain/product`, every serial scheduler
  wave emits `ApplyDeferredCommands` then `ProductPublication`, ECS exposes
  product-agnostic barrier hooks, engine runtime owns publication staging, and
  editor field-product artifacts publish through app-owned barrier handling;
- Phase 2 query snapshots and strict consumer policy are complete:
  `domain/product` owns strict consumption decisions and query-snapshot
  publication reports, every serial scheduler wave emits
  `ApplyDeferredCommands`, `ProductPublication`, then
  `QuerySnapshotPublication`, ECS exposes product-agnostic source generation
  helpers, engine runtime owns query snapshot staging/publication/invalidation,
  renderer inspection reads snapshot decisions without backend handles, and the
  editor viewport publishes observation snapshots through app-owned barrier
  handling;
- Phase 3 render product selection producers are complete: `domain/product`
  owns typed render-selection state and ratification, engine render preparation
  stores producer-scoped `RenderProductSelection` contributions, prepared-frame
  inspection exposes selected products, target descriptors, residency requests,
  and diagnostics without backend handles, and the editor viewport produces
  selections from accepted query snapshots during `RenderPrepare`;
- Phase 4 derived GPU residency is complete: `engine/plugins/render` owns
  logical renderer GPU cache handles, derives residency from prepared render
  product selections, allocates, preserves, invalidates, evicts, rejects, and
  journals cache state deterministically, exposes read-only residency
  inspection without backend handles, and the editor viewport records concise
  residency summaries while world render-cache invalidation removes stale typed
  cache entries;
- Phase 5 procgen readiness is complete: the accepted
  `domain/procgen/README.md` contract defines procgen ownership, graph-backed
  generator documents, seed/scope/version policy, cache lineage, authored
  overlay preservation, runtime/offline policy, server-validated multiplayer
  authority, and product output paths through the completed execution
  substrate;
- Phase 6A procgen domain product track is complete: `domain/procgen` owns
  graph-backed deterministic documents, first-slice terrain/material node
  semantics, planning metadata, reservation diagnostics, semantic ratification,
  deterministic lowering to `world_ops::OperationRecord` windows, changed-region
  explanations, and product job/publication descriptor builders; at the Phase
  6A closeout, editor providers, preview/bake execution, field payload bytes,
  and concrete generator algorithms remained deferred;
- Phase 6B visible procgen overlay proof is complete: `runenwerk_editor` owns
  procgen runtime proof state and concrete graph/preview providers, publishes
  procgen operation-window and field-candidate descriptors only through
  product/query barriers, selects accepted snapshots for render/residency, and
  exposes bounded changed-region/reservation overlays plus diagnostics while
  concrete terrain/material algorithms, field bytes, bake commands, and
  persistence remain deferred;
- Phase 6C concrete terrain/material CPU preview proof is complete:
  `domain/procgen` forms deterministic scalar-distance and material-channel
  `world_sdf::FieldPreviewProduct` payloads from bounded procgen documents,
  publishes the formed preview descriptors through product barriers, snapshots
  them through query barriers, and exposes editor preview summaries without
  renderer rebuilds, GPU upload, worker pools, caves, stamps, or scatter;
- Phase 6D procgen bake/rollback/persistence proof is complete:
  `domain/procgen` forms offline bake outcomes with `world_ops` operation
  records, formed field-preview products, product descriptors, changed regions,
  explanations, and rollback evidence; `runenwerk_editor` publishes accepted
  bakes through product barriers, restores last-good bake products on rollback,
  persists app-owned bake archives, and classifies `ProcgenGraph` reloads as
  live `ProcgenPreview` products;
- `world_sdf`, material, texture, asset/import, and editor product surfaces
  align with product-core metadata while preserving their owning-domain APIs;
- render prepare carries backend-neutral `RenderProductSelection` metadata as
  prepared frame state without GPU handles or renderer-owned world truth.

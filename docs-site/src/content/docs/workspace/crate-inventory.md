# Crate Inventory

This document records active workspace crates and their intended layer. Update it when workspace membership changes.

## Layer rules

- `foundation`: low-level reusable primitives with no domain/runtime/app dependencies.
- `domain`: engine-agnostic reusable contracts and logic.
- `engine/runtime`: runtime composition, plugins, renderer/backend integration, and app loop glue.
- `net`: transport/session/replication/history contracts and transport adapters.
- `app`: runnable applications and tools.
- `adapter/tool`: external host integrations and tooling glue.

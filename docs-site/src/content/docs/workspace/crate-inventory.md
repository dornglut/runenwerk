# Crate Inventory

`Cargo.toml` is executable truth for workspace membership. This page is the canonical human-readable inventory of the active Runenwerk workspace and must contain exactly those local workspace-member paths.

Dependency direction, peer-framework ownership, and clean-cutover rules live in [`../guidelines/dependency-rules.md`](../guidelines/dependency-rules.md). Detailed semantics remain with the owning crate/domain/framework documentation.

## Layer rules

- `foundation`: low-level reusable primitives with no domain/runtime/app dependencies.
- `domain`: engine-agnostic reusable contracts and logic owned by Runenwerk while they remain local.
- `engine/runtime`: runtime composition, plugins, renderer/backend integration, and app-loop glue.
- `net`: Runenwerk simulation/history support plus engine-owned networking integration.
- `app`: runnable applications and tools.
- `adapter/tool`: external host integrations and tooling glue.

## Active workspace members

### Foundation

| Crate | Path | Layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `foundation/id` | foundation | Typed identity primitives and allocators. |
| `id_macros` | `foundation/id_macros` | foundation | Attribute macro support for typed ID wrappers. |
| `diagnostics` | `foundation/diagnostics` | foundation | Structured diagnostic reporting vocabulary. |
| `ratification` | `foundation/ratification` | foundation | Shared ratification report vocabulary. |
| `schema` | `foundation/schema` | foundation | Portable schema identity, version, shape, field, constraint, metadata, and descriptor vocabulary. |
| `commands` | `foundation/commands` | foundation | Portable command contract vocabulary. |
| `resource_ref` | `foundation/resource_ref` | foundation | Portable external resource references. |

### Core domains

| Crate | Path | Layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `geometry` | `domain/geometry` | domain | Geometric primitives and queries. |
| `asset` | `domain/asset` | domain | Asset identity, descriptors, import planning, dependency graph, diagnostics, and ratification contracts. |
| `product` | `domain/product` | domain | Formed-product descriptors, jobs, query snapshots, diagnostics, policies, and ratification contracts. |
| `world_ops` | `domain/world_ops` | domain | World-operation logs, quantization policy, dirty tracking, build queues, invalidation, and replication deltas. |
| `world_sdf` | `domain/world_sdf` | domain | SDF world-product payloads and collision/query integration contracts. |
| `scene` | `domain/scene` | domain | Scene-domain data contracts. |
| `graph` | `domain/graph` | domain | Runenwerk-local authored port-graph definitions, typed ports, validation, traversal, and cycle policy. |
| `texture` | `domain/texture` | domain | Texture product, sampler, color-space, compression, preview, ratification, and lineage contracts. |
| `material_graph` | `domain/material_graph` | domain | Authored material graphs, catalog boundaries, ratification, lowering, source maps, and formed material products. |
| `procgen` | `domain/procgen` | domain | Deterministic procgen documents, planning metadata, ratification, lowering, and product publication. |
| `drawing` | `domain/drawing` | domain | Drawing documents, strokes, brushes, composition, commands, ratification, and tile formation contracts. |

Reusable spatial identity/addressing mechanics are not local workspace crates; Runenwerk consumes standalone `runen-spatial` and retains world/product integration in the owners above.

## External peer frameworks consumed by Runenwerk

Exact dependency revisions are executable truth in root `Cargo.toml` / `Cargo.lock`.

- `runen-net` and `runen-net-quic` — standalone RunenNet authority/transport realization consumed by Runenwerk networking integration.
- `runen-spatial` — standalone reusable spatial identity/addressing mechanics.
- `runen-gpu` — standalone GPU execution authority consumed by Runenwerk/RunenRender integration.
- `runen-ecs` — standalone ECS authority consumed by Runenwerk through an exact accepted Git revision; implementation and downstream conformance live in `dornglut/runen-ecs`.

RunenECS is no longer a local workspace member. Runenwerk retains only
integration/public-API guidance; the standalone repository is the sole ECS
implementation and conformance authority.

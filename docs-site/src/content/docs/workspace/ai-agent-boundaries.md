# AI Agent Boundaries

The root [`AGENTS.md`](../../../../../AGENTS.md) owns the Runenwerk executor contract. Organization-wide GitHub and GPT Web connector procedure belongs to [`dornglut/engineering`](https://github.com/dornglut/engineering).

This page owns only the Runenwerk-specific placement rule for runtime AI integrations.

## Runtime integration placement

Runtime AI integrations belong in:

```text
apps/
tools/
adapters/
```

Do not add LLM clients, prompts, autonomous agents, or workflow-specific AI policy to `foundation/` or pure `domain/` crates.

Tool-assisted development and repository automation do not make runtime AI a foundation or domain semantic owner.

## Concept ownership

Use [`../guidelines/architecture.md`](../guidelines/architecture.md) for Runenwerk code placement and boundaries, [`./crate-inventory.md`](./crate-inventory.md) for current local package locations, and [`../guidelines/dependency-rules.md`](../guidelines/dependency-rules.md) for dependency direction and peer-framework ownership. Do not duplicate those authorities here.

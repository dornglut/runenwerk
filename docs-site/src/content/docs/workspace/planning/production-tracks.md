# Production Tracks

Use this file for strategic production-track planning in Markdown.

## PT-UI-COMPONENT-PLATFORM

Track ID: `PT-UI-COMPONENT-PLATFORM`

Title: UI Component Platform

State: active

Goal:

```text
Make reusable Runenwerk UI controls and component surfaces story-proven, descriptor-backed, inspectable, and consumable by Gallery, Workbench, UI Designer, and future product tracks without moving reusable control semantics into those consumers.
```

Milestones:

```text
001 ControlPackage / ControlKernel contract — completed by user report
002 Authoring Kit — completed by user validation report
003 Story proof envelope consumption — completed by user validation report
004 Catalog / discovery / inspection — completed by user validation report
005 Input / gesture / device — completed by user validation report
006 State binding / host intent — completed by user validation report
007 Theme / state / style — completed by user validation report
008 Accessibility / focus / inspection — completed by user validation report
009 Layout / container / virtualization — active design/planning
010 Render surface / output — future
011 Base control packages — future
012 Generic interaction — future
013 Overlay / popup / layering — future
014 Minimum text editing — future
015 Generic text — future
016 Surface2D — future
017 SpatialCanvas — future
018 NodeCanvas — future
019 PortGraphCanvas — future
020 ProgressionTreeView — future
021 TrackSurface / Timeline — future
022 Transitions / effects — future
023 Adoption gates — future
024 Runtime-proven closeout — future
```

Design gates:

```text
Phase 9 implementation requires the Layout / Container / Virtualization design to be accepted first.
Each later milestone requires its own owning design or planning update before code.
```

Evidence gates:

```text
Phase 1: local validation and branch/PR evidence.
Phase 2: user reported the authoring-kit validation gate green.
Phase 3: user reported the story-proof validation gate green.
Phase 4: user reported the catalog validation gate green.
Phase 5: user reported the input validation gate green.
Phase 6: user reported the state/host-intent validation gate green.
Phase 7: user reported the theme/state/style validation gate green.
Phase 8: user reported the accessibility/focus/inspection validation gate green.
Later phases: layout, rendering, adoption, diagnostics, docs evidence, and runtime-proof gates as appropriate.
```

Current blocker:

```text
Phase 9 is design/planning only until ui-component-platform-layout-container-virtualization-design.md is reviewed and accepted.
```

Next action:

```text
Review and accept the Phase 9 Layout / Container / Virtualization design, then open a bounded implementation pass on its branch.
```

## Rules

- Production tracks guide sequencing.
- Production tracks do not authorize code without an owned implementation scope.
- Strategic order must be readable without generated views.
- Legacy structured track files may remain as optional mirrors.
